"1","Phew...reading this tread reminds me of just how many great scenes this show has. I found myself agreeing to nearly all off them.

One underrated early favourite of mine is in season 2, when Sam, Grenn and the Dolorous are beyond the wall and the third horn blast is heard for the first time. Chills.","season 2"

"3","Core books of A Song of Ice and Fire series:

1. _A Game of Thrones_ corresponds to Season 1
2. _A Clash of Kings_ corresponds to Season 2
3. _A Storm of Swords_ corresponds to Seasons 3-4
4. _A Feast for Crows_ some plotlines used from Season 5+
5. _A Dance with Dragons_ ditto
6. _The Winds of Winter_, unfinished, material from some sample chapters used in Season 6
7. _A Dream of Spring_, title of what's supposed to be the final novel, someday

Prequel novellas in “Dunk &amp; Egg” timeline, about a century before ASOIAF, collected in _A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms_. These were originally published as non-spoilery jumping-on points for new readers between the early novels, and you can read them whenever you like. Some D&amp;E elements are referenced in the later novels as Easter eggs (and may also be clues towards/set up important historical stuff), especially in AFFC onwards:

1. “The Hedge Knight”, originally in _Legends_ anthology edited by Robert Silverberg, reprinted with some commentary by GRRM in his _Dreamsongs: A RRetrospective_ short story collection
2. “The Sworn Sword”, originally in _Legends II_ anthology
3. “The Mystery Knight”, originally in _Warriors_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois

Prequel fake history books, written in the style of a maester recounting and commenting upon past events:

1. _Fire &amp; Blood_, covering approximately half the time since the Targaryen Conquest 300 years before ASOIAF. Parts of this have previously appearead as the following novellas which were originally published in anthologies (mostly minor changes, “The Princess and the Queen” is the most expanded). NB: this starts straight at the Conquest and doesn't cover the situation leading up to it, which you'd have to get from TWOIAF if you're interested:

	a. “Sons of the Dragon” with Aegon the Conqueror's heirs, originally in _The Book of Swords_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois  
	b. “The Princess and the Queen”, rivalry of Rhaenyra and Alicent which will be part of House of the Dragon show, originally in _Dangerous Women_ anthology  
	c. “The Rogue Prince”, some events of TPATQ focusing on Daemon Targaryen, originally in _Rogues_ anthology

Prequel fake history books that are tie-in supplements:

1. _The World of Ice and Fire_, heavily illustrated lorebook/artbook, with the first half giving a history from the earliest prehistorical times, then the Conquest and the reigns of all the Targaryen rulers up until just before Robert's Rebellion more than a decade before the start of ASOIAF. The back half gives regional histories for all Seven Kingdoms, plus the lands of Essos and beyond. Only parts of it are written by GRRM (as sidebars from “Maester Gyldayn”), the rest written up by his co-authors from his notes.  
  
  NB: there's a couple of spoilers for particular major events from AGOT through ASOS in the fake intro and the fake outro, so you may choose to skip reading those parts until you've finished those novels (and maybe also Dunk &amp; Egg since some of the history chapters give away the fates of certain guest characters), but otherwise pretty much everything else in it won't involve details of the main series storylines.
2. upcoming _The Rise of the Dragon_, again mostly done by GRRM's co-authors, basically a rewrite of parts of F&amp;B into a more encyclopedic style like TWOIAF, lavishly illustrated with new art

Other supplementary books:

- _The Lands of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in book of foldout maps showing all the regions in more detail and full colour, nice to have, but note necessary
- _A Feast of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in cookbook with recipes based on the series, foreword by GRRM
- _The Wit and Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister_, just quotes from the books, with a few cartoony illustrations, IMHO not worth it unless you find it in a bargain discount bin and are morbidly curious
- “A World of Ice and Fire” official tie-in app for Android &amp; iOS devices, done by the TWOIAF co-authors. Wiki-style mini-encyclopedia of characters and places throughout the books with illustrations taken from other official tie-ins, with a slider that can be set per-book (paid content) to avoid spoilers. Apparently has some trivia tidbits not found in TWOIAF and the official fansite's wiki, taken from GRRM's notes. The free section has the entirety of the entries for the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas, as well as several but not all of the TWOW sample chapters released so far (easiest way to read most of them, IMHO), and a few more sample chapters from TWOIAF, and sample maps from TLOAIF.

Not a tie-in, even though the back copy advertises it as such:

- “The Ice Dragon”, a novella set in an entirely different fantasy universe, but some of whose ideas were speculated to have been used in Season 7 and might be relevant to future novels, available reprinted in _Dreamsongs_ and in a standalone illustrated hardcover/ebook edition.
- you may also come across mention of “Blood of the Dragon”, “Path of the Dragon”, and “The Arms of the Kraken”. These are just novellas compiled from selected POV chapters from the ASOIAF novels, repackaged into a storyline following just the one character as a promo.

Bonus editions with extras:

AGOT through ASOS are currently available in rather nice The Illustrated Edition anniversary hardcovers with artwork depicting characters and events (there are also other licensed illustrated editions from specialty publishers with different art, but these are the more common and affordable ones from Penguin Random House &amp; HarperCollins Voyager).

And the entire series so far is also available in a very nice The Enhanced Edition for Mac/iOS devices from the Apple iTunes Store, which has handy features showing a map of where each character is at the start of their chapter (taken from _The Lands of Ice and Fire_ mapbook), a recap of what happened in the last, a character glossary recapping what happened to them in previous books, some artwork and sample passages read from the audiobooks, and some footnotes giving worldbuilding background details and trivia tidbits (mostly pulled from interview quotes and GRRM's notes given to his helpers).

All the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas are available in a graphic novel adaptation if you like comics, and so are AGOT and ACOK in collected editions (ASOS is apparently also being done, but currently unfinished).

Hope this helps!","season 2"
"4","&gt;She locked up her dragons because it crisped one child.

Counterpoint: She was going to raze all of Astapor and Yunkai... innocents and thousands of children and all... because she was super pissed.

Like, I get it... she absolutely has a kind-hearted side... no one is denying that. She did amazing things all across Essos. This Kind-Hearted persona is a part of her character no doubt... check.

But the point that the story makes is that she also possesses this Fire and Blood persona, which is just as valid as a part of her character as her Kind-Hearted persona... and these two personas create this conflict within her.

&gt;\&gt; It just kinda appeared out of nowhere the whole I wanna burn everyone...

Absolutely not true. This is nothing new for her, as she very clearly has shown a willingness/capacity to raze entire cities multiple times... and as early as early Season 2.

Qarth. Astapor. Yunkai. Mereen. Has literally, on-screen, clearly stated a willingness/desire/capacity to raze each and every one of those cities.

Hell, Tyrion literally had to stop her, on-screen, from committing genocide across two entire cities back in Essos.

Absolutely not *""kind of appeared out of nowhere"".*.. at least not to those with an unbiased viewpoint of her character.

&gt;\&gt; Maybe it’s a problem with how I see the characters.

I think everyone should revisit the story and try to do so with fresh eyes, with an unbiased viewpoint. Try to see what is actually portrayed on-screen, and try to view these issues from other POVs and not just through the lens of the characters you love most.

It's easy to excuse a character's actions when you always see their actions and choices through their specific lens, but revisiting the story from a different or more neutral perspective helps to flesh out their actions instead of painting it with a pre-conceived biased perspective.

I think this sort of approach would help people see the red flags they perhaps overlooked/handwaved the first time through.

&gt;\&gt; Danerys I see as someone growing into a ruler who’s not evil and doesn’t see people as tools like most leader in GOT that want the throne.

Except Dany DOES see people as tools... just not as often as other leaders.

She literally went to Astapor specifically to purchase slaves... tools for her political gain.

She demands Hizdar marry her while he's wrongfully imprisoned... tool for her political gain.

She appropriates the Dothraki fighters to become sacrificable pawns in her personal upcoming battles (and basically wiped them out)... tools for her political gain.

She demands the Gold Road POWs to serve her or die... tools for her political gain.

She only agrees to an alliance with the North when she realizes that *she needs those people* in order to protect her goal of sitting the Iron Throne... tools.

She demands the North march south the moment she wants to help her win what she wants when she wants it... tools.

So let's not pretend like she's magically free of seeing people as tools. Want to argue she does it less, or is also able to see people as people? Sure, but she certainly sees/uses people as tools for her own personal gain, absolutely.

Just pointing out that she isn't perfect... she isn't some wholly benevolent figure... and she absolutely has this Fire and Blood persona alongside her Kind-Hearted side... *conflict within the human heart* and all that.","season 2"
"5","He was oooooold in season 2. No way he was still alive.","season 2"
"6","I would say the moment she said I want to be THE queen we see her true self. That was in season 2 when Stannis kills his brother","season 2"
"7","They didnt cut it out. Dorne was part of the story since season 2. Season 7 was good. Season 8 was a masterpiece, not flawless but damn ambitious. Propably too much for its own good.","season 2"
"8","Rewatching right now and thoroughly enjoying it so far. I'm on season 2 and I am just enjoying the ride even though I know where it leads.","season 2"
"9","I'd say you're lucky you watched it in one go, I watched each season again shortly before the next season, So season 1 then watched it again before season 2 release, Then 1 and 2 before season 3 , then 1,2 and 3 before 4 and so on until the end. It was sad to have put that much time in but it was my favourite show and the best thing I'd watched. to have it end like it did made it seem like a waste. I still enjoyed the earlier seasons and I'm currently rewatching them (Just finished s1) Struggling to motivate myself to get through them though.","season 2"
"10","I watched it live from season 2 and usually rewatched before each season until the last one came out… then I didn’t touch anything GOT related until this weekend, when I started a rewatch with my partner who also hadn’t watched since it ended because of the disappointment. Well we just finished season 1 and I’ve been loving it so far! The characters, the story and the world is all so interesting and rich still! Not sure how I’ll feel as it goes on but at least enjoying seeing it all again after so long. The first few seasons were so great and I do think the first at least holds up still :)","season 2"
"11","Yes she did learn, did you see how fast main nameless man killed all those dudes in season 2.

And yeah its lazy and dumb but for example when Batman does it fans shout badass and awesome it was.","season 2"
"12","When did they even sign this? Sean Bean was only in season 1 and Natalie Dormer didn’t show up until season 2","season 2"
"13","I agree. I’m not arguing that. But some of the expectations WERE too high. 

My biggest example is that of Azhor Ahai. Azhor Ahai is never mentioned by name on the show ONCE and he is only vaguely referenced in passing one time in Season 2. I understand the book delves very heavily into this, but the show is an adaptation. The show is not beholden to anything in the books unless it actively sets it up. If it’s not referenced on the show, the expectation should be that it’s for a reason and because they’re going a different route. Same thing with the valonquar. The prophecy on the show is more bare bones. Yet all these theories were based on the books. I warned people not to expect pay off for those things since the show didn’t actively set them up and turns out I was right.","season 2"
"14","&gt;Yes, Tyrion ordered people to be burned during a battle in Season 2... and he was horrified by it when/after it happened, and doesn't want that to have to happen again.

Tyrion says this to Dany in season 7.

*TYRION: Oh first she'd torture you in some horrible way, then she'd murder you. Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me.* ***But if we go to the capital, we'll go with two armies, we'll go with three dragons, and anyone touches you, King's Landing burns down to the foundation stone.***

He was also pushing for Dany to starve everyone in Kings Landing.","season 2"
"15","The sex scene don't bother me. And honestly, the first season was hard to get through, but by season 2 I really enjoyed it, and by season 3 I was hooked.","season 2"
"16","It is mostly good good. Not anywhere near season 1 but better than season 3 &amp; kinda on the same level of season 2.

Edit: Only 3 episodes are aired till now though. I saw the medieval world in the promo of this season.","season 2"
"17","Was season 4 good? I lost all interest half way through season 2.","season 2"
"18","Good suggestion, thanks! I think I will do that. I loved season 1 and somewhat enjoyed season 2 but just couldn't get into season 3 at all, even though I really wanted to","season 2"
"19","&gt;Exactly as she was supposed to be, as she was written.  It's amazing how many viewers never got past that, that they couldn't figure out her evolution as a character was a big part of the story.

Which is strange because, IIRC, even as early as Season 2 she's showing growth. She's showing some realization that she's been some naive girl, she shows a clear desire and appreciation for Winterfell, she starts learning politics a bit, and sees Joffrey/Cersei for who they are. 

And that grows into her literally doing everything she can for Winterfell in the latter seasons. 

&gt;\&gt; I've seen people say that they hate Sansa because she was mean to Dany, like kids at a playground or something. If any more evidence were needed that a lot of folks' views on GoT are driven by the pretty blonde queen not winning the game, there it is.

Absolutely. It's wild that some people claim Sansa is some evil bitch because she's defending her homeland from 'usurpers' while Dany's whole Westeros story is basically the same thing. And it does reinforce the notion that some viewers wholly supported Dany to the point where they see anyone who stands in her way as some evil opponent, no matter how 'just' or reasonable their actions may have been.","season 2"
