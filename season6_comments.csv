"1","Intro to Season 6, Episode 10, no contest. IMO, it is the best example of storytelling through cinema that I have ever seen. The music, the use of silence, ending with poor Tommen stepping out the window while Cersei smiles and sips her wine unaware that in saving herself she has sacrificed her last living child. There truly aren't enough words. Incredible.

Honorable mentions, Sansa's coronation (all hail the Queen in the North) and Jaime bathtub scene (a man can ACT).

&amp;#x200B;

BOOK SPOILERS AHEAD--

If we're talking books, it's Quentyn Martell freeing the dragons. The reader is led through the scene by Quentyn processing movements in the dark, catching glimpses of the dragons as he goes. The way the dragons are described is mesmerizing.  We see a lot of Drogon in the show so it is nice to get such in depth descriptions of Rhaegal and Viserion on the page.","season 6"
"2","Jon Snow beating up Ramsay Bolton inside of Winterfell near the end of the Battle of the Bastards.  It was the climax of the Stark children returning to glory.  It was at the part of the story where Jon was emerging as the story's protagonist.

It's a shame GOT didn't end then, after season 6.","season 6"
"3","&gt;“A monster has taken our home and our brother, we have to get them back.” They weren’t seeking power.

Yes they were.

*JON SNOW: We can’t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men.*

&gt;John was saying that THEIR treason has already been punished, because they were dead and the issue was moot.

Which suggests Jon would have executed them if they hadn't died.

&gt;I don’t see how that proves Arya wrong?

Sansa you mean? She ostensibly\* thought that placating Robbet Glover would keep him on Jon's side. It didn't. Letting people get away with open disrespect is a bad idea when you're at the head of dictatorship.

\*I don't know what she was supposed to be thinking in the final version, but the outline for season 7 has Sansa going along with what Robbet Glover said because [she was trying to steal Jon's position](https://imgur.com/a/hdV4ByK).

&gt;Literally any other punishment, put in a dungeon,

Did you notice that no one was sentenced to prison during the show? The only times we saw the dungeons was when someone was being tortured, waiting for trial, or waiting for their execution. No one was sentenced to a prison term because that's not a thing in that world. You have to have a certain amount of excess to think keeping people alive in cages is prudent thing to do. Jon wasn't going commit to feeding a bunch of traitors through winter.

&gt;kept as a servant prisoner like Osha,

Kept as a slave you mean? Slavery is illegal in Westeros. Keeping warriors that refuse to kneel as slaves is also a good way to get yourself murdered.

&gt;Yes I know he refused it, that’s not the point, the point is Tyrion offered it because he knew execution was wrong.

Tyrion oversaw the execution of two slavers at the end of season 6. Not to mention the fact that he murdered his father and ex girlfriend.","season 6"
"4","Not giving any spoilers, but you start to hate him initially but on later seasons you'll start loving him after he ""redeems himself"" , and you'll definitely cry when he finally dies. He did actually make up for all harm he did , and in the end that means everything.. His character development was incredible.. But to get full context, you've to atleast watch season 6, so keep watching","season 6"
"5","Last 3? I thought season 6 was one of the best.","season 6"
"6","Very true.

In hindsight, I think season 6’s finale would’ve been the perfect ending to the show. Don’t get me wrong - in 2016 I would have said “no way!” But if I knew how bad it was going to get, I would absolutely take that ending over what we got","season 6"
"7","Jon should've died. How many times was he surrounded by hundreds of enemies and then saved at the last second cliche like an MCU movie or something? I was sick and tired of Jon come season 6. His plot armor was so thick not even Drogon, Greyworm, and thousands of Dothraki could kill him.","season 6"
"8","Core books of A Song of Ice and Fire series:

1. _A Game of Thrones_ corresponds to Season 1
2. _A Clash of Kings_ corresponds to Season 2
3. _A Storm of Swords_ corresponds to Seasons 3-4
4. _A Feast for Crows_ some plotlines used from Season 5+
5. _A Dance with Dragons_ ditto
6. _The Winds of Winter_, unfinished, material from some sample chapters used in Season 6
7. _A Dream of Spring_, title of what's supposed to be the final novel, someday

Prequel novellas in “Dunk &amp; Egg” timeline, about a century before ASOIAF, collected in _A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms_. These were originally published as non-spoilery jumping-on points for new readers between the early novels, and you can read them whenever you like. Some D&amp;E elements are referenced in the later novels as Easter eggs (and may also be clues towards/set up important historical stuff), especially in AFFC onwards:

1. “The Hedge Knight”, originally in _Legends_ anthology edited by Robert Silverberg, reprinted with some commentary by GRRM in his _Dreamsongs: A RRetrospective_ short story collection
2. “The Sworn Sword”, originally in _Legends II_ anthology
3. “The Mystery Knight”, originally in _Warriors_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois

Prequel fake history books, written in the style of a maester recounting and commenting upon past events:

1. _Fire &amp; Blood_, covering approximately half the time since the Targaryen Conquest 300 years before ASOIAF. Parts of this have previously appearead as the following novellas which were originally published in anthologies (mostly minor changes, “The Princess and the Queen” is the most expanded). NB: this starts straight at the Conquest and doesn't cover the situation leading up to it, which you'd have to get from TWOIAF if you're interested:

	a. “Sons of the Dragon” with Aegon the Conqueror's heirs, originally in _The Book of Swords_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois  
	b. “The Princess and the Queen”, rivalry of Rhaenyra and Alicent which will be part of House of the Dragon show, originally in _Dangerous Women_ anthology  
	c. “The Rogue Prince”, some events of TPATQ focusing on Daemon Targaryen, originally in _Rogues_ anthology

Prequel fake history books that are tie-in supplements:

1. _The World of Ice and Fire_, heavily illustrated lorebook/artbook, with the first half giving a history from the earliest prehistorical times, then the Conquest and the reigns of all the Targaryen rulers up until just before Robert's Rebellion more than a decade before the start of ASOIAF. The back half gives regional histories for all Seven Kingdoms, plus the lands of Essos and beyond. Only parts of it are written by GRRM (as sidebars from “Maester Gyldayn”), the rest written up by his co-authors from his notes.  
  
  NB: there's a couple of spoilers for particular major events from AGOT through ASOS in the fake intro and the fake outro, so you may choose to skip reading those parts until you've finished those novels (and maybe also Dunk &amp; Egg since some of the history chapters give away the fates of certain guest characters), but otherwise pretty much everything else in it won't involve details of the main series storylines.
2. upcoming _The Rise of the Dragon_, again mostly done by GRRM's co-authors, basically a rewrite of parts of F&amp;B into a more encyclopedic style like TWOIAF, lavishly illustrated with new art

Other supplementary books:

- _The Lands of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in book of foldout maps showing all the regions in more detail and full colour, nice to have, but note necessary
- _A Feast of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in cookbook with recipes based on the series, foreword by GRRM
- _The Wit and Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister_, just quotes from the books, with a few cartoony illustrations, IMHO not worth it unless you find it in a bargain discount bin and are morbidly curious
- “A World of Ice and Fire” official tie-in app for Android &amp; iOS devices, done by the TWOIAF co-authors. Wiki-style mini-encyclopedia of characters and places throughout the books with illustrations taken from other official tie-ins, with a slider that can be set per-book (paid content) to avoid spoilers. Apparently has some trivia tidbits not found in TWOIAF and the official fansite's wiki, taken from GRRM's notes. The free section has the entirety of the entries for the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas, as well as several but not all of the TWOW sample chapters released so far (easiest way to read most of them, IMHO), and a few more sample chapters from TWOIAF, and sample maps from TLOAIF.

Not a tie-in, even though the back copy advertises it as such:

- “The Ice Dragon”, a novella set in an entirely different fantasy universe, but some of whose ideas were speculated to have been used in Season 7 and might be relevant to future novels, available reprinted in _Dreamsongs_ and in a standalone illustrated hardcover/ebook edition.
- you may also come across mention of “Blood of the Dragon”, “Path of the Dragon”, and “The Arms of the Kraken”. These are just novellas compiled from selected POV chapters from the ASOIAF novels, repackaged into a storyline following just the one character as a promo.

Bonus editions with extras:

AGOT through ASOS are currently available in rather nice The Illustrated Edition anniversary hardcovers with artwork depicting characters and events (there are also other licensed illustrated editions from specialty publishers with different art, but these are the more common and affordable ones from Penguin Random House &amp; HarperCollins Voyager).

And the entire series so far is also available in a very nice The Enhanced Edition for Mac/iOS devices from the Apple iTunes Store, which has handy features showing a map of where each character is at the start of their chapter (taken from _The Lands of Ice and Fire_ mapbook), a recap of what happened in the last, a character glossary recapping what happened to them in previous books, some artwork and sample passages read from the audiobooks, and some footnotes giving worldbuilding background details and trivia tidbits (mostly pulled from interview quotes and GRRM's notes given to his helpers).

All the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas are available in a graphic novel adaptation if you like comics, and so are AGOT and ACOK in collected editions (ASOS is apparently also being done, but currently unfinished).

Hope this helps!","season 6"
"9","yes I loved season 6 and season 7 was average but when I say “unhappy endings” I mean good characters dying and not getting what they deserve or character’s storyline’s kind of being ruined because of certain events.","season 6"
"10","well I watched it all in one go so I didn’t have to wait for any seasons so I understand that disappointment after having to wait a while. I do agree this was the worst season and it just wasn’t the same as the others but I’m not completely disappointed. I also liked season 6, I think it was my favourite, especially the last episode. I’m not sure why people don’t like that as well. Anyways, I understand all your points and agree with some but I’m just not feeling as angry as everyone else.","season 6"
"11","Season 6 and 7 were like fairytales the hell you mean unhappy endings","season 6"
"12","I agree with this to an extent. However, I do feel like season 6 is superior to season 5, and they didn’t have much to go off of by then. I’m looking forward to rewatching season 6 to see if I still feel the same.","season 6"
"13","Dany and Jamie scenes.

Some viewers sure love to whinge about how those character arcs ended, but seemingly tend to forget/are unaware that their actions/choices in the end absolutely have had the groundwork laid for them across their entire arc leading up to Season 8.

Some people, over time, seemingly placed these two characters on some pedestal where only some grand animated Disney resolution would suffice, but, on-screen, these characters are portrayed as gray characters capable of both great and terrible acts, often based on both great and terrible choices.

Dany so often shows this Fire and Blood persona throughout her arc (as her advisors constantly tell her to tone it down) and her relationship with *power* becomes an increasingly suspect one, as when she doesn't have it she curses those who abuse it, but then as she gains power seemingly abuses it herself. Her whole arc is a series of hypocritical words/acts mixed with this fiery persona building up to a boiling point as her world comes crashing down upon her during her time in Westeros.

Also, people love to claim that her ""entire story"" revolved around helping the innocent, but that wasn't really the case, as it was a temporary goal of hers from midway in Season 3 (she literally went to Slaver's Bay in order to specifically purchase fighting slaves) to the end of Season 5 (when she rides off on Drogon.) That's it... aside from one single episode in Season 6, so maybe 25 episodes out of 70+. It's a nice arc, and certainly helps show off one side to her character (that many fans latched onto) but hardly an ""entire story"" as tends to get parroted. She spends Seasons 1, 2, half of 3, 7 and 8 trying to win the Iron Throne for herself... clearly a majority of her on-screen time.

As for Jaime, he so clearly has this soft spot for Cersei and literal life-long bond with her that I'm surprised so many people were gobsmacked by his decision. He literally spends 7+ seasons doing anything/everything for her while not giving two fucks about anyone not named Lannister (or Brienne), but people seemingly are surprised that he went back to her simply because he slept with someone else once over 40+ years? And are surprised that he stated that he didn't care about people, despite it being pretty obvious for 7+ seasons that he didn't care about people. I mean, there are specific scenes when he is with Cersei when he literally states that he doesn't care about anyone else, but somehow people think their own personal head canon/interpretation of the bath scene magically supercedes what he literally states on-screen about the commonfolk.

I honestly believe if you review these two characters with an open mind and fresh eyes, that Season 8 is not ""as bad"" as many people claim. Sure, the last seasons will always be a bit rough, but I think having a unbiased understanding of these two characters will help anyone understand how these two arcs end by shedding a neutral light on how these characters got to this point.","season 6"
"14","I honestly think I liked the season 6 best, and I think it did have a bit of the book material still. Well, at least I can say I liked its final episode, Winds of Winter, most from the whole show--the story was sad and grandious, and the cinematography and music absolutely stunning.","season 6"
"15","Season 6-8 they were out of book material completely. Seasons 1-4 are a lot stronger because they had the books to work off of.","season 6"
"16","The first three books are amazing and the world that Georges created is fantastic, but adapting a story from books to television isn’t an automatic success. There are a lot of great books that become shitty tv shows/movies.

The adaptation was incredible and that’s on them. They also added a lot of scenes and most of them are acclaimed. Five of the six highest rated episodes are show-original stuffs. Season 6 was considered one of, if not the best season of television while Ep9-10 were considered the best two episodes of television history. That’s on them.

At the end of the day, they made this show what it is. The casting, the soundtracks, the sets, costumes, it’s all due to them and who they hired to work with. Yes, the universe was already imagined and the story was partly written, but they put this unfinished story created to be unadaptable on screen and it became one of the biggest, most popular and critically acclaimed TV show of all time. They made Game of Thrones themselves with the A Song of Ice and Fire from Georges.","season 6"
"17","""They've had enough""

Yeah, we know. They checked out at the end of season 6.","season 6"
"18","Season 6 Episode 10 23 minutes 41 seconds or so.","season 6"
"19","The Winds of Winter (season 6, episode 10). Best ever episode of television.

Best season is 4 however.","season 6"
"20","I feel you. I shifted my expectations after the show surpassed the book content. Around season 6 (which is a season I still love) I noticed it slowly start inching into the standard Hollywood action movie level of writing the more that D&amp;D, your typical Hollywood writers, got more creative control. More shortcuts in the story were being taken, plot conveniences started occurring more, survival capabilities started turning more into comic book movie level. For me, it was never to the extent that it ruined the seasons and the positives of those seasons always outweighed the negatives. And I personally feel the same with season 8. Even though the tonal shift was a bit jarring due to what the show was for the first 4 or 5 seasons. Even then, especially since the issues I listen above really took a toll on S7, going into season 8 stressing over every detail wasn’t necessary. That’s like going into a Marvel film and expecting Breaking Bad or The Wire level of writing. Not saying it’s right, and I’m not saying the season shouldn’t have been fleshed out way better, but just because it could’ve been way better doesn’t mean we still got a dumpster fire of a season like some seem to act like. And I think more people are noticing this as they rewatch the series.

For me, it’s more of a case of I’m not going to let a few unideal things ruin the show I spent years of my life enjoying, especially when in my eyes, there was a lot in those seasons I could enjoy. And it was more than just the spectacle. I liked where all the character arcs ended up even if getting there was a tad clumsy.","season 6"
"21","Rewatch it. I constantly rewatch it till the end of Season 6. Honestly every-time you rewatch you pickup new details","season 6"
"22","I agree with you about having it being sent out to a proper authenticating service.  However. None of those signatures look identical in formation. There are scribbles. Some are neat some have large loops some small. Some with left hand leans some with right. 

To your last point. That doesn't matter much when did you get yours signed. When was this signed. If yours was signed in season 1 and this season 6 or vis versa there you go actors especially after getting into cons where the sign 3000 times a day change their signatures to accommodate. 

Source : watch pawn stars and then say hmmm make sense or say yeah as people evolve so doese their hand writing

The source only applies to the last point btw

Edit. Do me a favor since you must be a handwriting analyst too circle in corresponding color all those letters you mentioned. Please. Cause I can make out like maybe one or maybe a pair so please help me out.","season 6"
"23","I rewatch up to around season 6, and then continue watching but tend to skip or fast forward through some of the worse scenes and skip some episodes here and there. The rewatchability is still there, and season 1-4 is some of the best telly.","season 6"
"24","Finished S7 yesterday and I don’t even remember what happen. I was about to type Ramsey but that man died in season 6.","season 6"

"31","&gt;But at that point who is Daenerys to the Tarleys if they have already pledged allegiance to the Crown and Daenerys has not yet conquered?

The Taryls owed their oath of fealty to the Tyrells. Not ""the crown"". That's why they backed the Tyrells in rebelling against Joffrey and Stannis.

&gt;Their Queen is Cersei -

How exactly did Cercei become their queen? She wasn't in the Baratheon line of succession. Her sitting on the throne doens't mean she automatically becomes everyone's queen.

&gt;so who is Daenerys to pass judgement and be jury and executioner to the Tarlys at that point?

The queen of the people they had just gotten through stealing from and murdering.

&gt;Is she not just a foreign invader to them at that point ?

No. Randyll's peers sent ships to bring Dany's army over to Westeros at the end of season 6. I don't know how people forgot that.","season 6"
"32","This wasn't obvious in the show because Randyll wasn't actually introduced until season 6, but the Tarlys supported the Tyrells in backing Renly against Joffrey and Stannis. They clearly didn't see their allegiance as being to ""the crown"".","season 6"
"33","Shh, they aint ready to hear this.

The show coasted on Season 6. Aside from Hold the Door, which was something given to the showrunners by GRRM, the whole thing was pretty much stalling until episode 9. I still enjoyed it immensely, but I did every season.

And I agree with you about S7. Eastwatch is my least favourite episode of the entire show.","season 6"
"34","Stop at the end of season 6","season 6"
"35","Hord up, hord up. I guess you can thank grrm for the source material and the books of course, but the show is all about DD for all the good and bad. Actually season 6 is where the source material is no more; from what I’ve read, season 5 is the last season based on the events of the books. However season 6 is a stand alone miracle season. No spoilers, but it’s one of the best seasons, and just think about what you’ve seen so far for yet another season topping prior ones.","season 6"
"36","Battle of the Bastards from season 6 is the greatest battle scene ever put to film, for me (closely followed by the Battle of Stirling in Braveheart and the opening battle in Gladiator). It’s my favourite episode of tv ever! And this is why GoT is so frustrating - it has some of the greatest moments in tv history and yet also has some of the most disappointing moments too. It’s worth watching for those incredible moments but it’s so hard to recommend to anyone now because you know the final payoff is so unworthy of what came before and they will ultimately be left feeling disappointed.","season 6"
"37","Anyone that ever asks me about watching I always say end at season 6 and it will be the best series you’ve watched","season 6"
"38","I don’t know dawg, it’s almost like ASOIAF/GOT were always subversive (metatextually subversive too since it’s all a riff on Fantasy tropes) and Season 6’s “payoffs” were actually them lining by up the dominoes so that the last stretch of the show could knock them all down.

Like don’t get me wrong, Season 6 is an incredible season of television, but it’s no better written than Seasons 7 and 8. All I can hear off of threads like this is that you like it better since stuff went well for the characters you like in a way you don’t really have to think about (and, to be clear, I’m aware how pretentious that makes me sound). Daenerys sailing west with a massive armada is great - Daenerys immediately fucking that up and never recovering is way better and much truer to her character","season 6"
"39","nah, it just caused sansa to resent him later on. he should have probably tried to team up with jon from the start to get the loyalty of the north,  


he should have waited to act until season 6.","season 6"

"41","God's the final two episodes of season 6 were amazing, the hype was off the chart, why could they have not got the ending right, makes me sad I would have rewatched that show over and over for the rest of my life it really was top tier TV until season 8","season 6"
"42","No end at season 6 finale","season 6"
"43","You are mistaken.  GOT ends at season 6.","season 6"
"44","First off, might want to dispel the notion that her entire identity was about freeing slaves and realize that literally most of her screentime was spent pursuing power for herself. 

Seasons 1, 2, and the beginning of 3? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. Seasons 7 and 8? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. So 4.5 seasons of conquering versus less than 3 about freeing slaves (back half of Season 3, Season 4, Season 5, one episode in Season 6.. the clear minority.)

Her time in Slaver's Bay was a single arc, not some 'whole' identity. 

That said, I think a fresh and unbiased rewatch always helps paint a clearer picture of the issue. 

Season 8 completely implodes her world around her. If you see her psyche as a Jenga tower, it's easy to see how it becomes increasingly unstable throughout the final season until it is this unstable, teetering structure that finally topples over in an emotional moment. 

Her support structure crumbles (deaths, betrayals), her hopes and dreams and beliefs shattered (Jon's heritage reveal, she's not the Chosen One, Westeros doesn't love her) and her promising relationships all sour (killed, betrayed, Jon's romantic relationship ends.)

Keep in mind she's a young adult with a fucked-up upbringing (sold, raped, etc) with a Fire and Blood persona and family history of mental issues. Her entire world comes crashing down on her in a short amount of time, and this is a person who, has literally stated from her own mouth multiple times previously that she is capable/willing to raze entire cities if she feels the ends justify the means. 

She clearly states, in the latter episodes an increasingly deteriorated mental state, that she now sees the people of King's Landing as 'supporting' Cersei (ie, enemies) and that she has decided to ""Rule by Fear.""

Then, once she sees the Red Keep, that Jenga tower that's been teetering on a single piece because of all the other pieces that once held it in place are missing, finally topples over, and that Fire and Blood persona that's been bubbling up all this time is finally unleashed in full force. 

Wish we could have gleaned more context from the scene if we could have seen her as she razed part of King's Landing, but unfortunately we didn't get to see her again until the aftermath in the next episode.","season 6"
"45","Stop at the end of season 6","season 6"
"46","I’m glad I’m not alone, season 6 does have some amazing episodes though, mothers mercy is one of my favourites.","season 6"
"47","Yes. I highly recommend watching it. That’s a great show indeed. Five seasons are based on books so the plot there is on point. Season 6 is great and 7 is good too imo but after that things start to go downhill.

Even if you decide not to watch season 8, there’s still plenty of episodes to enjoy.","season 6"
"48","Yes season 8 was that bad. JFC

There wasn't a single episode in that season that was even mediocre. 

Season 6 and 7 at least had some okay to good moments, but Season 8 was absolutely that bad.","season 6"
"49","I don't feel the same way, but I understand why you'd feel that way.

The main reason why I don't feel that way is that, tbh, in my opinion the show started going downhill in season 5 and kept slowly going downhill for season 6, 7 and 8. So by the time season 8 rolled around I was already pretty emotionally disconnected from it all and wasn't expecting anything good.

I prefer to see seasons 1-4 as the REAL show and the canon show and think of 5-8 as some fan fiction that never happened. That allows me to enjoy seasons 1-4 for what they are, I think. Because I consider that the full TV story.","season 6"
