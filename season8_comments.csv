"1","I really liked Mance's speech to Jon about refusing to kneel. And Stannis offering Jon the chance to become Jon Stark and become Lord of Winterfell.

I fantasize about an open world GoT game where Jon kneels as the game starts. You play as Jon Stark and prevent season 8 from happening","season 8"
"2","I went back and watched the entire series again. And now. Don’t hate me. Because season 8 was terrible from writing and the story and the dialogue but after binging it all vs watching it as it came out…

I actually liked the big story beets from 50000 foot view. I get what the show runners wanted to do and convey the execution was terrible. Like I legit said at the end when Danny burned the city “you know what fuck it. She deserves this. Fuck Westeros.”  And it’s true. The entire continent is just filled with trash and bad people and Danny got fucked by everyone she let into her life. I understood her motives and understood why she had to be stopped but the writing and pacing was terrible. 

also looking back. You know what? Ned and Robb stark were both dumb as hell and honestly the entire stark family is the personification of failing up.","season 8"
"3","Arya is eerily unhinged. Not sure why the show glorified that scene. They hype up revenge and mass murder then turned around in season 8 and had the Hound preach to the mass murderer that revenge = bad and had Arya be the sympathetic POV character for Dany torching a city.","season 8"
"4","I'm assuming you are talking about the season 8 part. I assume semi-autonomy would be the best compromise between them and the Targaryens for peace and so that the Targaryens won't invade. They would basically be a vassal state, and that we don't have enough time to explore more content.","season 8"
"5","I know there's a lot of varying theories in the nature vs. nurture debate. The problem is that the one who nurtured her from birth was Viserys, who I think we can all agree was not a good role model. When she is first shown she is quite timid and passive, but the Targaryen madness starts to leak trough early on. She lets her brother die a horrible death (granted, he kind of deserved it, but she didn't object to the cruel method). When Khal Drogo promises to raid and plunder and rape the Seven Kingdoms, she does not object, even being a victim herself. She burns Mirri Maz Duur, and enjoys it. Outside Qarth she promises she will return with fire and blood. She lets the dragons kill the undying (again, they were not good people, but still), and locks Xaro Zhoan Daxos and Doreah in that vault as soon as she realises their betrayal. At Astapor she burns the slavers (they were bad people, right?), and frees the unsullied. Granted, at Yunkai she's a bit more diplomatic, but the cruelty returns at Mereen when she crucifies those masters (slavery is horrible, surely they deserved it). Then when she is captured by the Dothraki, she burns the Khals (part of it was probably self defence, and she most likely had good reason to do so). Afterwards she takes command of the Khalasar, knowing full well that the Dothraki are a raiding and plundering people. At Mereen she burns some more slavers with the dragons, but that is understandable, as that is a battle.

Then she arrives at Westeros, and she has to face characters that we know. Her experiences have shown her that killing those she deems as enemies works out, and she believes that she is some sort of savior. So she doesn't really have any qualms about burning the westerosi. She kills the Tarlys this way, and has to be advised against just going to King's Landing with her dragons. Pretty much every time she encounters a problem throughout the show, her initial response is to kill and burn. Her advisors always stop her in time, but at the time of season 8, her trust in them is growing thin. Jorah and Barristan have died, and so did Missandei (whose final words were a callout for Daenerys to burn her enemies). Two of her children die in a short span of time, making her more unstable. Varys betrays her, and Tyrions openly doubts her more and more. Jon is loyal, but she is unable to trust him after she learns of his lineage (even though he is adamant he does not want to push his claims). That leaves Grey Worm, and he becomes hell bent on revenge after Missandei is killed.

So no, Daenerys would never be a good ruler. As a matter of fact, she'd be among the worst rulers of the Seven Kingdoms, right next to Maegor the Cruel, Aegon the Unworthy, Joffrey Baratheon/Lannister and her own father, the Mad King. Her reign would be one of fire and blood, and the innocent and guilty would suffer alike.","season 8"
"6","She looks like season 8…","season 8"
"7","The problem goes much deeper. They couldn't adapt book 4 completely, because it's for the most part unrelated to the main story. Feast for Crows feels like a spinoff within the series. You can see this in the narrative structure: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire#Narrative_structure

It's essentially a book about Cersei, Jamie, Brienne, Sam(!) and the Greyjoys. If you turn this into a full season, you ratings will take a dive even worse than during season 8. It was correct to merge it with Dance of Dragons. Last but not least, GRRM doesn't need time to finish the series, he needs motivation.","season 8"
"8","Season 1 Tyrion had the hairstyle of a 70s porn star. Season 8 is definitely an improvement.","season 8"
"9","&gt;Obviously she had a traumatic childhood, but she does become utterly obsessed with revenge and murder, to the point she ends up baking an entire house into a pie. 

Couple things: first off she did not ""bake an entire house into a pie"".. it was like a person or two. Yes, still super bizarre, no doubt, but that brings me to the second thing. 

The ""Frey Pie"" is an easter egg from the books that they have shoehorned into Arya's character. She doesn't do it in the books, but because the Northern politics are less prevalent in the show, they just gave her that action because she's a named character. 

Just saying it's not something that they wrote into the script because they believed her character was building up to this point... merely took what another family did and slapped it on her character.   

&gt;\&gt; Yet people cheer for her big time and very rarely point out how completly psychopatic her character arc is.

I think there's a huge gap between characters like Dany and Arya in regards to 'madness' or 'psychopathic tendencies' though. Dany, multiple times, has shown a capacity for genocide multiple times even before Season 8, literally claiming she would kill thousands of innocent people simply because she's pissed, whereas Arya just refused to kill a single innocent person and was nearly killed for such a refusal. 

That's two clearly different states of mind at play here. Sure, Arya kills a lot of people, but because of that Stark code of honor mixed with Yorren's list, she comes off as a much more stable and justice-focussed character.

Like, we see her spare the Frey women and children because she knows they weren't involved with the Red Wedding... it's not like she's just out for everyone's blood at times like Dany was. 

I think it's fine to raise an eyebrow and keep a close eye on Arya, sure, but labeling her a psycho simply because she seeks justice for the murder of her mother/brother/countrymen seems a bit of a stretch.","season 8"
"10","They could do that if the final season gets backed up as an alternate reality, but then they can fix all the plot holes.

"17","Exactly. It’s a huge reason for Dany’s massacre—his claim to the throne will get out, and people will prefer him, so she has to crush them into submission. She even says earlier in the ep (or in another I can’t remember) “fear it is”, meaning she is choosing to rule by fear. Yeah that whole thing is not particularly well executed but Jon’s identity is definitely relevant, of all the things to criticise season 8 for imo that’s not one of them.","season 8"

How tf did arya sneak past the white walkers and wights to stab the night king? Also dany burning all the people in kings landing after the bell was rung made me mad. The last season could've been a million times better","season 8"
"21","I'd watch this again unlike season 8.","season 8"
"22","I’m sorry man but there’s basically countless dissertations worth of information available to you if you are genuinely interested in why the final season was such a train wreck. So I don’t feel compelled to write yet another one myself. 

It’s fine if you enjoyed it. I have some less than stellar shows &amp; movies that I get a kick out of. However in the case of GoT season 8, it’s the contrast to the literal historic quality of the first 5 or 6 seasons that should make the decline to any discerning mind rather obvious….. 

And knowing that HBO &amp; GRRM himself felt the show needed multiple more seasons (minimum 10 seasons according to GRRM IIRC) to wrap things up, but D&amp;D decided to rush through it so they could continue advancing their careers with franchises like Star Wars… What is there even to debate? D&amp;D clearly rushed to wrap the series up to suit their career ambitions and the quality suffered. It’s not rocket science…..","season 8"
"23","&gt;She had everything she wanted and just opted for senseless cruelty.

If you honestly believe this then you need to revisit Season 8, as the last season clearly implodes Dany's entire world around her, leading her to a point where her psyche seems to be broken, as she is clearly a shell of her former self... she certainly did not have 'everything she wanted' as you mistakenly believe.

Her support structure crumbles through emotional deaths and perhaps even more emotional betrayals.

Her hopes, dreams, and beliefs are all shattered through Jon's heritage reveal (she's not *The Chosen One* as she believed) and the realization that Westeros doesn't love her.

Practically all remaining relationships have turned to ash in her mouth, as Jon doesn't want to pursue a romantic relationship and everyone else has basically died because of her actions or has betrayed her in some sense.

This so clearly is not *everything she wanted.*

What she wanted was to be The Chosen One, the Rightful Heir, with the people of Westeros adoring her, not unlike her time in Slaver's Bay. But that so clearly was not something she would be able to obtain once Jon's heritage was revealed/secret was out... hence she chooses Fear instead.

I agree a couple more episodes would have helped some pacing issues with every single arc, but I think it is fairly clear that this situation is so far removed from what she has built up in her head... this is not what she wanted, or rather the situation surrounding winning the Throne is so far from ideal that she states ""Let it be Fear.""

&gt;\&gt; This kind of total lunacy is the type of thing that would rightfully take years longer to build up to.

Which they ~~absolutely~~ *for the most* part did.

They have laid a fair amount of groundwork for this path across Dany's arc.

They show she has this Fire and Blood persona all the time. She literally screams that she will take what she wants with Fire and Blood. She cooly watches as people are inhumanely executed. She kills people who are innocent when she's pissed.  Her advisors, constantly, tell her to chill out/tone it down.

They have shown, *multiple times*, a very clear willingness/capacity to raze entire cities because she believes the ends justify the means.

And most of this happens during her time in Essos, where she is clearly trying to do good. But her doing good doesn't magically erase that Fire and Blood persona.

And her time in Westeros simply tears down the psyche of this young adult with a family history of mental issues and who herself had an incredibly fucked-up upbringing.

This is a person who has threatened to raze entire cities multiple times previously... and now her world is crumbling in upon itself.

If someone who threatened to shoot up a school multiple times, then fell on incredibly hard times (loses support relationships, lifelong goals/dreams shattered, promising relationships gone, etc), would you be shocked to learn that person shot up a school?

Not really, right? Because the pre-cursors, like literally threatening this very act multiple times previously, are there... the groundwork for such an act is there.

Just like it was with Dany.

Just have to be able to take off the rose-colored glasses in order to see the red flags for what they are.","season 8"
"24","So, does it just cover season 8 then? 

;)","season 8"
"25","I'm willing to overlook bad logic for a cool moment once in a while. Season 8 just overloaded me and it's hard to overlook THAT much shit. Just my opinion.","season 8"
"26","&gt;Yes he can go back on honour for his love but the writing needs to be in a way that makes it a big deal. It felt like I’m going back to Cersi and all I cared about was poor Brienne.

Sure, like all of Season 8, it could have been written better, absolutely. I certainly wouldn't claim it was written/executed masterfully... merely that this arc makes absolute sense for his character. There is nothing surprising/shocking/out of character for this person to return to the person he has a literal life-long bond with. Sleeping with another woman one time doesn't magically undo a 40+ year bond, as some people seem to think.

That said, I would actually argue that him basically sacrificing his life/future just to be with Cersei one last time is arguably a culmination of his ""honor"" arc, considering it may be the most honorable thing he's done on-screen... sacrificing his future just to be with his sister/lover one last time in her hour of need.

I mean, if the roles were reversed and he left Cersei to be with Brienne one last time, everyone would cheer it and love it and talk about ""honor"", but because the names are reversed and the viewer is meant to be disappointed, suddenly the act itself is overlooked as being 'honorable.'

&gt;\&gt; So Danerys arc and development she kills evil people, so slavers ect. But the slavers she killed hanged corpses on crosses so quite evil. The sons of harpy killed her friends army and devastated the city. But no there’s innocent people their so I’m not going to kill everyone. What’s even better here is it didn’t even come up as an option.

This is a character who has, very clearly, shown a willingness/capacity to commit widespread genocide over entire cities, innocents and all, multiple times. That's fact.

She absolutely has inhumanely executed innocent people, multiple times. That's fact.

She, herself, stated she was going to raze Astapor and Yunkai before Tyrion had to stop her from doing so. That's fact.

Her world completely imploded across Season 8 (support structure crumbled, hopes and dreams shattered, relationships turned to ash in her mouth) and she seemingly reached a boiling point where that Fire and Blood persona was finally fulfilling the very threat she's meaningfully made previous times before.

And to be clear, I'm not dismissing all the good she did in Seasons 3, 4 and 5... merely pointing out that she is a character with two clearly distinct and warring personas... *conflict within the human heart* and all. Yes, she has a kind-hearted persona, no doubt, but she so clearly has this Fire and Blood persona that threatens to erupt multiple times long before Season 8... and as her hopes and dreams are soured that Fire and Blood persona threatens to be unleashed in full force... which it eventually was.

It's there. On-screen. The groundwork absolutely was laid for this potential arc. If you honestly don't see it, I would recommend revisiting the show with fresh eyes and an unbiased stance, as plenty of people have pointed out these very issues in regards to Dany for years... long before Season 8 ever aired.

Sure, a couple more episodes would have helped with pacing, no doubt, but her arc constitutes a huge path of red flags... even across Essos when she was doing her 'best work.'

"32","Dany and Jamie scenes.

Some viewers sure love to whinge about how those character arcs ended, but seemingly tend to forget/are unaware that their actions/choices in the end absolutely have had the groundwork laid for them across their entire arc leading up to Season 8.

Some people, over time, seemingly placed these two characters on some pedestal where only some grand animated Disney resolution would suffice, but, on-screen, these characters are portrayed as gray characters capable of both great and terrible acts, often based on both great and terrible choices.

Dany so often shows this Fire and Blood persona throughout her arc (as her advisors constantly tell her to tone it down) and her relationship with *power* becomes an increasingly suspect one, as when she doesn't have it she curses those who abuse it, but then as she gains power seemingly abuses it herself. Her whole arc is a series of hypocritical words/acts mixed with this fiery persona building up to a boiling point as her world comes crashing down upon her during her time in Westeros.

Also, people love to claim that her ""entire story"" revolved around helping the innocent, but that wasn't really the case, as it was a temporary goal of hers from midway in Season 3 (she literally went to Slaver's Bay in order to specifically purchase fighting slaves) to the end of Season 5 (when she rides off on Drogon.) That's it... aside from one single episode in Season 6, so maybe 25 episodes out of 70+. It's a nice arc, and certainly helps show off one side to her character (that many fans latched onto) but hardly an ""entire story"" as tends to get parroted. She spends Seasons 1, 2, half of 3, 7 and 8 trying to win the Iron Throne for herself... clearly a majority of her on-screen time.

As for Jaime, he so clearly has this soft spot for Cersei and literal life-long bond with her that I'm surprised so many people were gobsmacked by his decision. He literally spends 7+ seasons doing anything/everything for her while not giving two fucks about anyone not named Lannister (or Brienne), but people seemingly are surprised that he went back to her simply because he slept with someone else once over 40+ years? And are surprised that he stated that he didn't care about people, despite it being pretty obvious for 7+ seasons that he didn't care about people. I mean, there are specific scenes when he is with Cersei when he literally states that he doesn't care about anyone else, but somehow people think their own personal head canon/interpretation of the bath scene magically supercedes what he literally states on-screen about the commonfolk.

I honestly believe if you review these two characters with an open mind and fresh eyes, that Season 8 is not ""as bad"" as many people claim. Sure, the last seasons will always be a bit rough, but I think having a unbiased understanding of these two characters will help anyone understand how these two arcs end by shedding a neutral light on how these characters got to this point.","season 8"

I am also a believer that even if the ending season is bad in a series I have to watch it such as That 70s Show, Lost, TVD etc. It is always good to find out how the writers want to end the show. As well as that, if I rewatch these shows I usually just skip the last season, but I feel that every series is worth at least one full watch. I don’t think you’d regret watching the last season.

Your reading comprehension is incredibly low and I'm guessing this is why the terrible stupid writing of season 8 doesn't bother you.

"54","Not downvoting, but my sense is a few people tolerate it / came to like it ok, while most people thought it was terrible.  Honestly I've never seen anything resembling the degree of consensus there's been on GOT season 8 on any show (no matter how bad) so I think simply calling it 'divisive' is a bit misleading...

Can you find things to like in it? sure... but the character writing was just so bad.  You can come round to it, but you basically have to think about it as a different show or else massively lower your standards - which is my basic understanding of why it might become tolerable on a rewatch, even though it was intolerable to basically everyone who watched it on release.  ((Like there was... basically a global consensus that it was s\*\*\* compared to what came before.  Never seen anything like that before or sense xD ))

Edit: d\_unit4595 summed this up super well actually.  It's ""like going into a Marvel film and expecting Breaking Bad or The Wire level of writing"".

"56","I feel you. I shifted my expectations after the show surpassed the book content. Around season 6 (which is a season I still love) I noticed it slowly start inching into the standard Hollywood action movie level of writing the more that D&amp;D, your typical Hollywood writers, got more creative control. More shortcuts in the story were being taken, plot conveniences started occurring more, survival capabilities started turning more into comic book movie level. For me, it was never to the extent that it ruined the seasons and the positives of those seasons always outweighed the negatives. And I personally feel the same with season 8. Even though the tonal shift was a bit jarring due to what the show was for the first 4 or 5 seasons. Even then, especially since the issues I listen above really took a toll on S7, going into season 8 stressing over every detail wasn’t necessary. That’s like going into a Marvel film and expecting Breaking Bad or The Wire level of writing. Not saying it’s right, and I’m not saying the season shouldn’t have been fleshed out way better, but just because it could’ve been way better doesn’t mean we still got a dumpster fire of a season like some seem to act like. And I think more people are noticing this as they rewatch the series.

For me, it’s more of a case of I’m not going to let a few unideal things ruin the show I spent years of my life enjoying, especially when in my eyes, there was a lot in those seasons I could enjoy. And it was more than just the spectacle. I liked where all the character arcs ended up even if getting there was a tad clumsy.","season 8"
"57","&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Finally shes willing to take a public stand for something (Northern Independence)that many of the people around her want.

I'm going to guess this wasn't an intentional choice by D&amp;D, but The Northmen didn't earnestly want independence. They were, at best, opportunist. The northern lords would have helped Jon and Sansa get rid of Ramsey if they actually wanted independence. The Starks had 405 northmen on their side while Ramsey had 5k+. 

&gt;Those things give her power.

One of the sillier retcons between seasons 7 and 8 is Sansa's shifting opinion of the northern lords. Here's what she said to Littlefinger when he was trying to get her to betray Jon:

&gt;*SANSA: Yes, they turned their backs on Jon when it was time to retake Winterfell and then they named him their king and now they're ready to turn their backs on him again. How far would you trust men like that? They're all bloody wind vanes*.

Cut to season 8 and she trusts the ""wind vanes"" to help her rebel against someone with a huge army and two dragons? That doens't make any sense.","season 8"

So either they had staff writers that were uncredited that were actually good writers.

&gt;Lol, just because a line is spoken doesn't magically make it some ironclad truth... wild that 8 seasons of Game of Thrones hasn't taught you that.  
&gt;  
&gt;I mean, you seemingly claim a character's word is ironclad and cherry-pick some quote as if it's gospel, but when I point out that she, multiple times STATED ON-SCREEN she going to kill thousands upon thousands of innocents because she wanted to, that doesn't count in your eyes? Only the quotes you cherry pick matter or count as canon or can be construed as fact? Any quotes that disprove your quotes magically don't count because Dany reasons?  
&gt;  
&gt;Talk about bad faith discussion.  


I got plenty of more, ""I am not my father."" ""I am not here to be queen of the Ashes."" ""Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city."" ""I don't want another child's bones dropped at my feet."" ""I am a queen, not a butcher.""   


And how am I cherry-picking? My point wasn't ""This is everything Danny has ever said this proves my point and your quote was fabricated."" That would be ridiculous.  


You brought up the scene where she threatens to burn all the wise masters cities while watching them attack her city and trying to burn it down. My point is that my quotes are just as viable as yours, and arguably more so since she actually acted on these, she did free the slaves, she chained up her dragons, and she only made the city-destroying threats for betrayal such as when the master broke a promise and attacked, or when Yunki and Astapor were retaken by them. The people of Kingslanding have not done anything of the sort and even still despite the masters being the worse and honestly even I would have defended her if she whipped them out she didn't likely not just for moral reasons but practicality as well as listening to Tyrion got her the ships she needed to sail to Westeros and abandon Mereen, which is an issue itself but I am trying to focus on season 8 and the shit stain that it is. 

&gt;I mean, if in one scene a character says they would never kill someone, then in multiple other scenes they clearly state they would kill someone, can you honestly defend the theory that they would never kill someone?  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course not.  


Here is the thing, I am not saying Danny would never kill someone, hell she smothered her own husband, she burned hundred of soldiers to death, no killing isn't my issue, good character like Jon have killed people, and it was much more hands on, but does that mean I can picture him ordering his men to sack and burn villages, cutting the throats of the smallfolk or turning them to ash on a Dragon? Hell no, and hey you know what, it would make more sense for Jon to do this than Danny because Jon actually has killed a kid with his own hands.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's not that complex... she's like a tea kettle. Over time the pressure builds and builds until that pressure literally reaches a boiling point. We know she has this Fire and Blood persona bubbling up underneath, Season 8 completely implodes her entire world, her psyche is shot and that Fire and Blood persona is no longer 'contained', and she reaches this emotional climax where that Fire and Blood persona hits a violent boiling point.  


You do know that by comparisons achieving boiling water takes longer then Danny falling into madness. At least then I can see the still water, then some bubbles forming at the bottom, every once in a while rising to the top until it does finally reach said boiling point and I can finally put the pasta in.   


Now I can agree, she has gone through a lot, I think they portrayed these tragic events poorly and it comes off more that she will kill everyone because Jon wouldn't fuck her rather than the grief of losing her dragon and Misandi, but my argument would be why is Danny so much weaker than everyone else?  


Jon, Sansa, and Arya have arguably gone through just as hard of times if not worse then Danny and are still somewhat mentally sound, the most fucked up being Arya but even she saw what Danny did and smartly said ""I no a killer when I see one."" WOW THANKS ARYA WE NEVER WOULD HAVE FIGURED THAT OUT!!! Shit getting of topic again.  


But if that doesn't work for you since they are different characters then lets just look at the shit that Danny when through season, her child turned into a stillborn and her husband a vegetable by a women who she tried to save, her kindness and trust resulting in losing two things very important to her. Dare I say that scene has far more justification for her to go mad but she keeps to her more kind-hearted nature and goes on her mission to free the slaves. 

&gt;Sure, I think the show would have benefitted from more episodes to help with some pacing issues, absolutely.. but there's enough 'dots' to connect to see the picture... even if the picture isn't as detailed as it probably could have been.  


Idk about that, with how much of a mess season 5-7 were, I feel like the dots you're saying are there to connect are just 6 points that make you draw a pointy mountain and the book tells you it's a castle. 

&gt;\&gt; for it saved many of the innocents in kingslanding, otherwise why do it?  
&gt;  
&gt;Wait... are you serious?  
&gt;  
&gt;How about to save his father? To save Lannister forces? To save himself? TO help the Lannisters gain power? Because he fucking hates Aerys and what he did to people both behind closed doors and in public?  
&gt;  
&gt;If you honestly believe the only benefit for him to kill the Mad King was solely to help the commoners, you desperately need to revisit the actual story, because  ALL THE REASONS make sense for why Jaime did what he did... not just the single one you've cherry-picked and pretend is some sole reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;I mean, he literally mentions 'father' first in the bath scene question he proposes to Brienne... clearly there is more than a single reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again, you're cherry-picking here and pretending like nothing else exists surrounding the issue... bad faith.  


I will admit that those reasons were part of it, yet the key component that can hold up to scrutiny is his want to save the people. For example, he never had a great relationship with his father and it only got worse when he joined the KG.  
Saving the Lannister forces would coincide with saving the people, after all if he dose not care about the small folk why would he care about his fathers soldiers? Not to mention he actually fights against them to defend the red keep which would likely be to defend what smallfolk were able to retreat into the castle. And of course he hated Aerys we don't often kill people we like, unless your Danny, or Jon, or Tyrion, oh shit Jamie killed his cousin (I got my issues with that scene as well) so maybe he didn't hate Aryes.   


And as far as saving himself there were plenty of moments he could have just gotten away without risking his life, even in a way so that his ""honor"" would be intact much like Baristan. Running away and coming back after saying he fought hard and barely survived the wildfire eruption.   
Protecting the smallfolk is what holds up best under scrutiny when you look to his actions even after the events before we see much development with him, stepping in to save Brienne from getting raped, jumping into a bear pit to save her, armoring her and arming her to go find and save Sansa.","season 8"
"75","It’s a good point and generally I would agree. But I also think there’s something to be said about ruminating on things and spinning wild theories over the course of years. Season 8 in particular had a 2 year gap. People went wild. I think it’s the opposite extreme of binge watching. Some of the theories I heard sounded so insane to me even at the time. I kept warning people to lower their expectations.","season 8"
"76","Season 8 is a lot more palatable to binge watchers. In my experience, they can still see the flaws in it, but they look at it a lot more objectively and it doesn’t ruin the show for them. The years of anticipation worked against the show and I think all the hype and expectation building (a lot of it self inflicted by the fans themselves) set the bar unacheivably high. 

The final season for sure failed to meet its full potential 100%….but I will die on the hill that the expectations from people watching it live were unreasonably high.","season 8"
"77","&gt;She actually only said once there would be no civilian casualties - in 702 - and only because Tyrion argued for it.

That's not what she said and that's not what Tyrion argued for. The writers needed Dany not to use her dragons so that they could justify Cersei staying alive. They accomplished that by having Tyrion suggest that any attack on Kings Landing would end in Dany mistakenly killing tens of thousands of civilians and being the ""queen of the ashes"". Tyrion jumping to that conclusion made no sense.

That's not even getting the fact that Tyrion's blockade idea would have killed more civilians than attacking the city outright.

&gt;Seems weird to fixate on that and just ignore the times she talked about how she would destroy cities or the very clear subtext throughout Season 7 and 8 that she wanted to just smash the city and was being held back by her advisors.

That ""subtext"" was the writers using Tyrion, Varys, and Jon  to gaslight the audience by putting words in Dany's mouth. What they were doing is very obvious if you go back and watch those scenes.

&gt;YARA: If you want the Iron Throne, take it. We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons. We should hit King's Landing now. Hard. With everything we have. The city will fall within a day.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.

No one mentioned turning the dragons loose. What is Tyrion even talking about when he mentions ""fire storms""? That's not a thing. The writers were just desperate to come up with a way to explain Dany not using her best weapons.

The writers have Tyrion and Jon pull the same BS when Dany suggests burning the Red Keep.

&gt;DAENERYS: I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: We've discussed this.

Tyrion was lying here. What they had talked about was Dany attacking Kings Landing. They never talked about her burning the Red Keep. They had Tyrion lie like this so that the audience would connect Dany's new plan with what Tyrion said about her being the queen of ashes in episode 2.

Dany then asks Jon what he thinks of the idea. He responds with:

&gt;JON: ..But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same.

At no point did Dany or anyone else mention burning cities. Dany specifically asked what Jon thought about her burning the Red Keep.

The leaked outline for that scene shows that Tyrion and Jon were supposed to have an issue with Dany using her dragons on anyone. [Including enemy soldiers.](https://imgur.com/2dacXf2)

The gaslighting got painfully obvious in episode 6 of season 7. Tyrion had spent the entire season freaking out whenever Dany or anyone else brought up using the dragons. The writers seemingly forgot that and had him say this nonsense:

&gt;TYRION: Oh first she'd torture you in some horrible way, then she'd murder you. Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me. But if we go to the capital, we'll go with two armies, we'll go with three dragons, and anyone touches you, King's Landing burns down to the foundation stone.

Tyrion flip flopping like this was already bad enough. It's gets worse.

&gt;DAENERYS: And right now she's thinking of how to set a trap.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: Of course she is. And she's wondering what trap you're laying for her.  
&gt;  
&gt;DAENERYS: Are we? Laying any traps?  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: If we want to create a new and better world, I'm not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start.

Why is Tyrion talking as if Dany was the one who brought up mass murder? He was the one that had just said that they would burn all of Kings Landing in response to his sister making an attempt on Dany's life.

The writers continued doing this manipulative nonsense in season 8.

&gt;DAENERYS: Cersei will make sure they don't believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King's Landing.

Dany hadn't said anything about destroying Kings Landing.

&gt;GREY WORM: We will storm the city, my queen. We will kill your enemies. All of them.

VARYS: Cersei needs to be destroyed, but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied and the Dothraki, tens of thousands of innocents will die. That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep. These are the people you came here to protect. I beg you, Your Grace. Do not destroy the city you came to save. Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.

The idea Vary puts forward here is nonsense. The writers didn't even attempt to validate his alarmism. Dany ends up getting the city to surrender without causing any serious collateral damage. The idea that Dany was being stopped from destroy Kings Landing was always nonsense.","season 8"

The people who are genuinely mad at how it ended are the people that felt it was too rushed and that 6 slightly longer episodes didn’t do an entire season (at least) worth of storytelling any justice. 

The series always gave the viewer room to breathe in between the big moments. Nothing ever felt like it was moving too quickly, and the slower paced moments always had meaning. They led to something. They gave you anticipation and allowed the viewer to become invested in the story. 

Season 8 abandoned nearly everything that made the show what it was originally. Sure, it had a ton of great moments and the acting was superb as usual but the show deserved more than what we got. Both seasons 7 and 8 deserved 10 episodes each. Then it would have likely felt like it didn’t sprint to the end.","season 8"

However, aside from that stupid interview, the main issue with scenes like this is now made plain to me again by watching it - that a lot of this dialogue is quite out of character, bearing attitudes that are not adequately set up, breaking the immersion with how hard the writers were trying to warp the characters around what they wanted to do without putting in the hard yards to make it make sense. Effectively a shift from character-driven storytelling of earlier seasons to plot-driven characters.

Just reminds me that season 8 was quality end points shrouded in a rushed array of set ups, really unfortunate how close it was to not being stilted.","season 8"

Season 8 then starts with a Winterfell under siegs by the dead and John wanting to save his sister.

I really don't know why they switched the final boss around. Would it have been anticlimactic with just the white walkers? Maybe, but season 8 always was more of a last hurrah than a deep new conflict/epic emotional culmination. Well, it's too late now... :)","season 8"

"91","&gt;\&gt; Rest, dany going mad, cersie-jamie, theon, jon, sansa, arya, tyrion ending, etc. all seems to make sense.

A thousand times this.

The biggest/loudest complaint about the final season seems to be something about *""character assassination/Character X ruined""*, but the groundwork for every arc (aside from Bran's) has been laid across the previous 70+ episodes. Dany's descent and capacity/willingness to raze entire cities because of that Fire and Blood persona. Jaime not giving two fucks about the common folk. Jon absolutely not wanting power or to deal with Westerosi politics. It's all clearly portrayed on-screen for the 80 hours leading up to the finale.

Sure, the quality of Season 8 was clearly sub-par, no argument there, as the writing definitely took a dip, but a huge majority of the character arcs certainly make sense when viewed through an unbiased lens, especially upon a rewatch.

Wish everyone were able to follow in your footsteps and revisit the story with fresh eyes, as I think a lot of issues were overlooked due to personal biases or simply missing details the first time through, so props to you for taking the plunge... hope you feel 'rewarded' for your efforts.

"98","What was wrong with Game of Thrones? People made the mistake of trying to look at it as “a work of art” when it was really just a money-making venture. Everybody involved in it got tired of it before the audience did and wanted to move on. If the people who make it get sick of it, how is the audience supposed to care? After getting paid a fabulous sum in advance for it, George R.R. Martin got tired of writing it and simply stopped writing it. Even today, he keeps saying he’s going to finish it, but no one believes him any more.

After he stopped writing, Benioff and Weiss were forced to write original material, something they really sucked at. Season 8 showed they have no talent in this area at all. When George opted out, the two faux writers decided to take GOT out behind the barn and shoot it. They did this in such a hurried and shoddy way that even the normally unperceptive and not swift audience took notice, and their was endless moaning and complaining about it. It was a huge debacle. George R.R. Martin cared Nothing for the outcry, Benioff and Weiss even less, and HBO least of all, because all of these entities made huge pots of money, the only reason that this whole cash cow was made. HBO was pleased to win the Emmy, not so pleased that half their viewership evaporated after GOT was gone.

Now it’s in the past, although the disappointment of the former fans still lingers. Audience, as long as you continue to put up with shoddy work, you are going to continue to get shoddy work for like Forever. Perhaps scrutinize the “next big epic” very closely before getting too involved. Amazon’s new LOTR movie, for instance. And of course, The Three Body Problem.","season 8"

"101","She wanted to break the wheel. Her description of the wheel is spokes that go round and round vying for power. To take out the spokes means her on top with zero dissent. Her views around dissent and how she deals with it make up the bulk of her story in Maareen; those that did not love her dethroned her. It was only with Fire and Blood, stamping them out, burning the slavers ships (which is of note in itself; previously she had waged war in a way as to not flambe slaves, it is only after she follows through with her threats that Maareen is truely 'won') to force a peace.

When she arrived in Westeros she had a strong claim, 3 dragons (who were difficult to kill) , a complete army of unsullied slaves and the horde army in the Dothraki. She was in a comfortable position, she had that much firepower its easy to be content and wait. There wasn't anyone who couldn't actually threaten her.

By the end she was in a much weaker position had a single dragon, half her army, her claim was being questioned by those who wanted Jon on the throne, along with the fact her closest 'friends' (and I'd argue she never had any friends, Missandei and Grey worm were in their minds repaying a debt and planning their life after Daenerys) were gone, and Westeros has weapon advancements that threatened the last remaining dragon.

Visares introduces the Machiavellian concept of 'Who can rule without fear or love?' in season 1. Danys entire story explores this, the point in Essos isn't to show us Dany like freeing slaves so much (there's really no need for 5 seasons of that...)  , more her situation, she is ruling over two peoples one with extreme version of love and one with a more extreme dislike, how she handles and ultimately resolves this feed into the finale.

During S8 she becomes disillusioned with Westerosi people. She does not believe she will be accepted, or loved. Her weak position makes her act more rash - going for Kings landing so soon after the battle at Winterfell is a form of desperation because she feels her power slipping away. In Essos she had a hard enough time controlled a percent of the population who rebelled.

By the time she leaves Winterfell she is erratic, acting irrationally, paranoid and delusional because of her state and slipping power. Losing another dragon only makes this worse. She can not rule without fear or love and she decides fear it is.

Burning it all is a more effective fear than just removing one person in power. Like the masters she needs to teach them she is willing to go Fire and Blood. The masters surrenders once and what good did that do her? She knows taking and sitting on a throne isn't a guarantee of power, she's been there. Power resides where men believe it resides.

Otherwise, Daenerys other characterisations allowed her to do this. While she has an affinity for freeing the enslaved, she also believes herself to be a sort of divine being, a fair number of her speeches before Season 8 go a bit *manifest destiny,* much of her final speech to her followers are all things we'd heard before but didn't have the same context.  Her long list of titles and general narcissism is best displayed in the scene where she meets Jon snow and talks about how faith in herself kept her going because she is special *'This is Jon snow... hes King in the North'* works as comic relief because the former was so self important and grandiose.

In S6 she's speaking with Hizdahr at the fighting pits and it's a really good dialogue into how far she is willing to go and *why;*

Daenerys - one day your great city will return to the dirt as well

Hizdahr - At your command?

Daenerys -- If needs be.

Hizdahr - And how many will die to make that happen?

Daenerys - if it comes to that, they will have died for a good reason.

Hizdahr - those men think they are dying for a good reason

Daenerys - - Someone elses reason

Daenerys didn't really change. Her situation did and she decided that now needs be, justified to herself by those that are dying are dying for a good reason (her reason), which she has long believed but previously not required (in her mind) .. Ultimately her want for unrivalled conquest was more important to her than the lives of those people, that is the conflict in Dany. The tragedy is it wouldn't have happened without the WW and Jon saga, the scary thing is she was always capable of deciding needs must.","season 8"
"102","They knew how they wanted to end it, but had no clue how they were going to get there. They’ve admitted this in interviews and allude to it in the post episode interviews. I don’t think it’s wrong to have fun reading theories. And the reason I am disappointed in the end of the series (seasons 7 &amp; 8) has nothing to do with my “internal fan fiction.” The series is incredibly complex and I assumed my ideas not even coming close to what they’d create because my imagination never reached that of GRRMS. The disappointment in a rushed ending with terrible dialogue and complete lack of character development is valid. You can disagree with me, that’s why it’s an opinion not fact. You even acknowledge they discussed the main characters but by season 8, all of the side characters became main ones and they didn’t have stories anymore. Brienne, Cersei, onion knight, Missandei, grey worm, Varys, the red woman, and so many others. So many stories that had development over the years just went nowhere imo. And watching interviews where d&amp;d comment that they didn’t really have a solid plan throughout is tough to hear.","season 8"
"103","&gt; They wouldn’t show up to a con because they didn’t want to answer fan questions after season 8. They’ve literally admitted to not knowing where to take the story and there was never a plan for how to end while the seasons were going, which is insane in my opinion.

GRRM said he gave D&amp;D his planned endings for all the major characters when D&amp;D spent two months with him in New Mexico getting their scripts to line up with his plans for the books.  HBO did want more GoT, but after D&amp;D explained their plans for the end of the series, HBO signed off on it happening that way.

You don't have to like their plans, but to deny that they even existed is a bit odd.

One of the worst things anyone could do in GoT was subscribe to fan theories.  IMO much of the dislike for the ending of the series came from viewers who expected to see their internal fan fiction on the screen and were angered when that didn't happen.  That the disgruntled faction is still indulging in this nonsense over three years after the end of the show is astonishing.","season 8"
"104","First off, might want to dispel the notion that her entire identity was about freeing slaves and realize that literally most of her screentime was spent pursuing power for herself. 

Seasons 1, 2, and the beginning of 3? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. Seasons 7 and 8? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. So 4.5 seasons of conquering versus less than 3 about freeing slaves (back half of Season 3, Season 4, Season 5, one episode in Season 6.. the clear minority.)

Her time in Slaver's Bay was a single arc, not some 'whole' identity. 

That said, I think a fresh and unbiased rewatch always helps paint a clearer picture of the issue. 

Season 8 completely implodes her world around her. If you see her psyche as a Jenga tower, it's easy to see how it becomes increasingly unstable throughout the final season until it is this unstable, teetering structure that finally topples over in an emotional moment. 

Her support structure crumbles (deaths, betrayals), her hopes and dreams and beliefs shattered (Jon's heritage reveal, she's not the Chosen One, Westeros doesn't love her) and her promising relationships all sour (killed, betrayed, Jon's romantic relationship ends.)

Keep in mind she's a young adult with a fucked-up upbringing (sold, raped, etc) with a Fire and Blood persona and family history of mental issues. Her entire world comes crashing down on her in a short amount of time, and this is a person who, has literally stated from her own mouth multiple times previously that she is capable/willing to raze entire cities if she feels the ends justify the means. 

She clearly states, in the latter episodes an increasingly deteriorated mental state, that she now sees the people of King's Landing as 'supporting' Cersei (ie, enemies) and that she has decided to ""Rule by Fear.""

Then, once she sees the Red Keep, that Jenga tower that's been teetering on a single piece because of all the other pieces that once held it in place are missing, finally topples over, and that Fire and Blood persona that's been bubbling up all this time is finally unleashed in full force. 

Wish we could have gleaned more context from the scene if we could have seen her as she razed part of King's Landing, but unfortunately we didn't get to see her again until the aftermath in the next episode.","season 8"
"105","The two people are the creators d&amp;d. There is a big theory that after season 8 was panned and fans were disappointed in how they finished the series they were completely over game of thrones. HBO wanted them to have more seasons but they were over it and ready to move on to a Star Wars project (which eventually fell through). They wouldn’t show up to a con because they didn’t want to answer fan questions after season 8. They’ve literally admitted to not knowing where to take the story and there was never a plan for how to end while the seasons were going, which is insane in my opinion. They cameoed in westworld killing Drogon showing they don’t give a shit about thrones fandom, etc. — I’m not saying any of this is fact obviously. It’s just a theory that I find pretty solid based on their responses to fans over the years since the series ended.","season 8"

"109","Don’t watch season 8. End with season finale of 7, then imagine your own ending. Anything you come up with will be better than the real ending","season 8"
"110","Bruh what? I love GOT, but season 8 is definitely as bad as they say.","season 8"
"111","don't watch it, run as far as you can from this piece of garbage that is season 8","season 8"
"112","As tragic as so many Targs are, especially the ladies, I suspect there won't be that many.  Moreover, there were also a lot of little ""Khaleesis"" and ""Daeneryses"" running around until after Season 8.  I've seen jokes in SM about the people who probably want to change daughters' names.  So I don't expect that trend to continue.","season 8"

And not only forward, but backwards; not backwards, but also upward. And as always: twirling, twirling, twirling towards Season 8!","season 8"

"115","I thought the show was going downhill long before the rushed season 8. Nonsensical plotlines started around Arya's arrival at the House of Black and White.","season 8"
"116","True, they did and that’s sad. But come to think of it, I’d rather they took a portion of the story and did it well that give us the sped up hack job that was season 8.","season 8"
"117","Even on set it felt rushed and not cared for. Unlike other seasons. It took the directors a whole day just to get the Hodor scene right. But season 8 just got yeeted out asap","season 8"
"118","Yes! When the scene happened I thought it was a really cool prequel moment to *the books*, not to Season 8. So it actually helps the anticipation for the book endings.

Back when GoT was at its best people were always debating and discussing cool new lore reveals and this utterly new reveal that Aegon actually conquered Westeros because he foresaw The Long Night is *awesome* and only adds to the world building and history!","season 8"
"119","Whoever is downvoting explain. Did anyone actually like season 8?","season 8"
"120","I came into the show having read the books first, so it was easier to follow. If I hadn't read the books I would never have watched the show. But the downside to this is that only 5 books have been published so far. I don’t think books 7 and 8 will ever see the light of day.

If you're itching to get started on HoTD, you shouldn't let not having seen the other one stop you. You could also read Fire and Blood (put it on hold at your library, but at mine the wait list is long) and then decide from there.

If you choose to watch GoT here's something to keep in mind:

Season 8 broke my heart, but not in the way a sad story will. It will make you distance yourself from your favourite characters because the showrunners were in a hurry to finish things up. If you can keep this in mind and not get too attached, it's a beautiful story.

I haven't the heart to watch HoTD just yet. I'm probably going to wait until a few seasons are over.","season 8"
"121","Holy shit I’m jealous how the hell did you like season 8 lol.","season 8"
"122","As bad as Season 8 was in general I think I would be able to somehow accept it and live with it. However, I wish I turned TV off in the middle of last episode. The very ending is so bad that no meme can justify that shit.","season 8"
"123","Save yourself the trouble and don't even bother with season 8. It actually makes the rest of the show worse by viewing it and ruins the ability to re-watch the series.","season 8"
"124","Yes. I highly recommend watching it. That’s a great show indeed. Five seasons are based on books so the plot there is on point. Season 6 is great and 7 is good too imo but after that things start to go downhill.

Even if you decide not to watch season 8, there’s still plenty of episodes to enjoy.","season 8"
"125","Then you look at season 8 and admire it right? Right????","season 8"
"126","Yes season 8 was that bad. JFC

There wasn't a single episode in that season that was even mediocre. 

Season 6 and 7 at least had some okay to good moments, but Season 8 was absolutely that bad.","season 8"
"127","But that was all Season 8 right?","season 8"
"128","Season 8 really left us with trauma","season 8"
"129","I disagree that it's an online thing. Have you heard anyone recommend game of thrones since it season 8 aired? I haven't. I have heard friends and family who are barely online tell people not to bother. I have had coworkers who can barely use a computer express anger and frustration over the season 8.

Their metrics may indicate it is okay, but it turned the show from a masterpiece into a joke. 

I need to stop typing now because I am getting angry over it, and the fact anyone would defend it.","season 8"
"130","I completely forgot how the season 8 intro looked.","season 8"
"131","I cannot stress enough that it was wonderful to see King's Landing once again, and not the crap-prop version that was used for season 8.","season 8"
"132","I'm impressed, i think going with all new characters and a time period way before GoT is what it needed to reset after the disappointment that was season 8 of GoT.","season 8"
"133","It's exactly the pilot this show needed.

The dialog is worlds better than late GoT but not quite up to the level of early GoT, but that is to be expected because they can't just lift from the books. The characters and the actors also seem good. I liked the focus on plot development rather than spectacle. Music is always good but I do hope we get more unique tracks moving forward rather than just rehashing the old score. I loved the costume and set design and am glad that we have more diversity in looks because at a certain point it felt like GoT just wanted a character to wear just one set of clothes.

I'm apprehensive about the decision to make the Long Night prophecy important to the story. On one hand, it makes sense that there were multiple Targaryens who believed that was their destiny (Rhaegar for example) and it is a very important part of ASOIAF. On the other hand that shit was so trash when it actually happened that forgetting that it was a thing might be for the better.

Most importantly I liked the sense of familiarity it gave back to me. I remember watching Season 8 of GoT and feeling that it wasn't even the same show anymore. But HotD felt very familiar with what I associate with GoT. Ten minutes in and I felt nostalgic. And I think that is something that was imperative to winning back fans who fell out of love with the series. Remind us why we fell in love with GoT in the first place.","season 8"
"134","I’m not even a fan of GoT and the top comments basically amounting to “season 8 wasn’t *that* big of a disaster, go and watch Thrones on HBO! It’s worth it!”","season 8"
"135","I don't feel the same way, but I understand why you'd feel that way.

The main reason why I don't feel that way is that, tbh, in my opinion the show started going downhill in season 5 and kept slowly going downhill for season 6, 7 and 8. So by the time season 8 rolled around I was already pretty emotionally disconnected from it all and wasn't expecting anything good.

I prefer to see seasons 1-4 as the REAL show and the canon show and think of 5-8 as some fan fiction that never happened. That allows me to enjoy seasons 1-4 for what they are, I think. Because I consider that the full TV story.","season 8"
