"1","I think they were quite good at writing some scenes for characters within the established material, the chat between Robert and Cersei in season 1 being another example, I think it was a combination of having to write completely new material which they just weren’t as good at it and being completely burned out at the end that led to the quality of series 7 and 8","season 1"
"2","People act like there was just unlimited time for filming. As it was, the kids from season 1 looked middle aged by the final season. Wish they could have stuck the landing better, but it was time to wrap it up.","season 1"
"3","She was cute as Arya in season 1 and 2, but let's be honest, she didn't grow up to be a pretty lady.","season 1"
"4","Season 1 Tyrion had the hairstyle of a 70s porn star. Season 8 is definitely an improvement.","season 1"

So there's good chances that you'll change your mind","season 1"
"8","First epi of season 1 they kill 1 person and let the other go (maybe he did get away but more likely he was allowed to).  


I always assumed it was a nice scare tactic. Let 1 or 2 people live to go back and tell the tales that will continue to build fear.","season 1"

"11","&gt;get past the wall and Westeros would have never been in danger from him.

This is not how they get past the Wall. They get past the Wall by tearing it down with a big Ice Dragon. The mark just means he knows where Bran is. 

I don't think it's true either they get past the Wall when they attack Mormont and Jon in Season 1.

Bran being dead doesn't stop the Beyond the Wall Dany losing her dragon plot. They could've also just incorporated the Horn of Joramun in that they'd left out of the show.","season 1"
"12","I mean I have a literature degree so I do feel I get where you're coming from but I think it just needed more time. Jaime definitely is a tragic character, with his tragic flaw being his weakness to his sister, but it wasn't really clear why he went back to her at THAT particular moment? Like one moment he's riding away from her to go off north, the next he's decided to return to her... but what was the internal journey between those points?

Contrast that with Ned's downfall in season 1; it was shocking for most viewers but it ""made sense""; he had clearly made mistakes within the rules of the world, and he was punished for it. It was surprising but not unsatisfying.","season 1"
"13","Core books of A Song of Ice and Fire series:

1. _A Game of Thrones_ corresponds to Season 1
2. _A Clash of Kings_ corresponds to Season 2
3. _A Storm of Swords_ corresponds to Seasons 3-4
4. _A Feast for Crows_ some plotlines used from Season 5+
5. _A Dance with Dragons_ ditto
6. _The Winds of Winter_, unfinished, material from some sample chapters used in Season 6
7. _A Dream of Spring_, title of what's supposed to be the final novel, someday

Prequel novellas in “Dunk &amp; Egg” timeline, about a century before ASOIAF, collected in _A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms_. These were originally published as non-spoilery jumping-on points for new readers between the early novels, and you can read them whenever you like. Some D&amp;E elements are referenced in the later novels as Easter eggs (and may also be clues towards/set up important historical stuff), especially in AFFC onwards:

1. “The Hedge Knight”, originally in _Legends_ anthology edited by Robert Silverberg, reprinted with some commentary by GRRM in his _Dreamsongs: A RRetrospective_ short story collection
2. “The Sworn Sword”, originally in _Legends II_ anthology
3. “The Mystery Knight”, originally in _Warriors_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois

Prequel fake history books, written in the style of a maester recounting and commenting upon past events:

1. _Fire &amp; Blood_, covering approximately half the time since the Targaryen Conquest 300 years before ASOIAF. Parts of this have previously appearead as the following novellas which were originally published in anthologies (mostly minor changes, “The Princess and the Queen” is the most expanded). NB: this starts straight at the Conquest and doesn't cover the situation leading up to it, which you'd have to get from TWOIAF if you're interested:

	a. “Sons of the Dragon” with Aegon the Conqueror's heirs, originally in _The Book of Swords_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois  
	b. “The Princess and the Queen”, rivalry of Rhaenyra and Alicent which will be part of House of the Dragon show, originally in _Dangerous Women_ anthology  
	c. “The Rogue Prince”, some events of TPATQ focusing on Daemon Targaryen, originally in _Rogues_ anthology

Prequel fake history books that are tie-in supplements:

1. _The World of Ice and Fire_, heavily illustrated lorebook/artbook, with the first half giving a history from the earliest prehistorical times, then the Conquest and the reigns of all the Targaryen rulers up until just before Robert's Rebellion more than a decade before the start of ASOIAF. The back half gives regional histories for all Seven Kingdoms, plus the lands of Essos and beyond. Only parts of it are written by GRRM (as sidebars from “Maester Gyldayn”), the rest written up by his co-authors from his notes.  
  
  NB: there's a couple of spoilers for particular major events from AGOT through ASOS in the fake intro and the fake outro, so you may choose to skip reading those parts until you've finished those novels (and maybe also Dunk &amp; Egg since some of the history chapters give away the fates of certain guest characters), but otherwise pretty much everything else in it won't involve details of the main series storylines.
2. upcoming _The Rise of the Dragon_, again mostly done by GRRM's co-authors, basically a rewrite of parts of F&amp;B into a more encyclopedic style like TWOIAF, lavishly illustrated with new art

Other supplementary books:

- _The Lands of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in book of foldout maps showing all the regions in more detail and full colour, nice to have, but note necessary
- _A Feast of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in cookbook with recipes based on the series, foreword by GRRM
- _The Wit and Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister_, just quotes from the books, with a few cartoony illustrations, IMHO not worth it unless you find it in a bargain discount bin and are morbidly curious
- “A World of Ice and Fire” official tie-in app for Android &amp; iOS devices, done by the TWOIAF co-authors. Wiki-style mini-encyclopedia of characters and places throughout the books with illustrations taken from other official tie-ins, with a slider that can be set per-book (paid content) to avoid spoilers. Apparently has some trivia tidbits not found in TWOIAF and the official fansite's wiki, taken from GRRM's notes. The free section has the entirety of the entries for the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas, as well as several but not all of the TWOW sample chapters released so far (easiest way to read most of them, IMHO), and a few more sample chapters from TWOIAF, and sample maps from TLOAIF.

Not a tie-in, even though the back copy advertises it as such:

- “The Ice Dragon”, a novella set in an entirely different fantasy universe, but some of whose ideas were speculated to have been used in Season 7 and might be relevant to future novels, available reprinted in _Dreamsongs_ and in a standalone illustrated hardcover/ebook edition.
- you may also come across mention of “Blood of the Dragon”, “Path of the Dragon”, and “The Arms of the Kraken”. These are just novellas compiled from selected POV chapters from the ASOIAF novels, repackaged into a storyline following just the one character as a promo.

Bonus editions with extras:

AGOT through ASOS are currently available in rather nice The Illustrated Edition anniversary hardcovers with artwork depicting characters and events (there are also other licensed illustrated editions from specialty publishers with different art, but these are the more common and affordable ones from Penguin Random House &amp; HarperCollins Voyager).

And the entire series so far is also available in a very nice The Enhanced Edition for Mac/iOS devices from the Apple iTunes Store, which has handy features showing a map of where each character is at the start of their chapter (taken from _The Lands of Ice and Fire_ mapbook), a recap of what happened in the last, a character glossary recapping what happened to them in previous books, some artwork and sample passages read from the audiobooks, and some footnotes giving worldbuilding background details and trivia tidbits (mostly pulled from interview quotes and GRRM's notes given to his helpers).

All the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas are available in a graphic novel adaptation if you like comics, and so are AGOT and ACOK in collected editions (ASOS is apparently also being done, but currently unfinished).

Hope this helps!","season 1"
"14","Ruined the show for me. I would rewatch it all the time. I probably saw season 1 10-15 times. Ever since the finale I haven’t had the urge to rewatch a single episode.","season 1"
"15","I still like season 1-7 and most of 8 it’s watchable and a good time. I still think there’s a difference in making a bad decision but that decision being based on the characters development compared to this is a twist thats more like how exciting. Jamie’s I can see where it came from but when he decided to go north, it should have been to save Cersi, not because he gave his word. When he went north the character developed was going in the way of honour something that through the show we see him struggling with. Yes he can go back on honour for his love but the writing needs to be in a way that makes it a big deal. It felt like I’m going back to Cersi and all I cared about was poor Brienne. 

So Danerys arc and development she kills evil people, so slavers ect. But the slavers she killed hanged corpses on crosses so quite evil. The sons of harpy killed her friends army and devastated the city. But no there’s innocent people their so I’m not going to kill everyone. What’s even better here is it didn’t even come up as an option. 

So then ok we want drama yes drama is good but how do we get drama true to her character is here good writing comes into it. So yes I want more then ooooo she snapped and burnt the city.

One of the best mistakes a character made was Cersi restoring the faith militant, which was very much to her character and made for great writing.","season 1"
"16","&gt;Jamie and Danerys arc annoyed me the most. 

I mean, that's the whole point of this gritty drama... we've watched it for 7+ years because it is this no nold barred experience that is ruthless and unapologetic. This is not some animated Disney film where all your favorite characters live happily ever after, and expecting as much seems incredibly naive.

We're supposed to be disappointed by the decisions that Dany and Jaime make, because they are humans conflicted within their own hearts. 

I actually think that if everyone just makes all the best decisions for themselves in the final seasons, it would feel incredibly hollow, fake, and unfitting for this show where the main character loses his head in the very first season because of a series of poor choices on his part... but that doesn't mean Season 1 is bad simply because a character we liked has a somber ending to his story.","season 1"
"17","Jamie and Danerys arc annoyed me the most. We spent years getting growth out of them for her to turn into her brother from season 1, and Jamie to go fuck it I’ll have a boring fight and completely regress as a character. Also with Jamie it ruins the completion of Cersi who should have died alone once she’s pushed everyone away. I also like the night king ep, but it’s chaotic which it should be but I feel not in a good way now that I’ve watched it again. I would have liked more then one episode about him finally crossing the wall and attacking. I also don’t understand her saying she’s going to conquer the rest of the 7 kingdoms, when John rules the north so that’s hers, the south and iron isles are hers and everyone else is dead.","season 1"
"18","Dany was definitely a main character, but she wasn't THE main character. And she was definitely built up as a villain all the way from season 1. Remember, her first instinct to solve problems was always to use fire and blood. The audience just didn't mind because she killed murderers and slavers and rapers. But through that she got the belief that she was right and when she came to Westeros she was unwilling to change her mind. This leads to her followers either becoming as fanatic as her or starting to doubt her (which leads her down a paranoia path). And then there is the fact that she is a Targaryen, and as the saying goes, every time a Targaryen is born the gods flip a coin. Dany's coin definitely landed on the wrong side, people just refused to see it.","season 1"
"19","i’ve seen GoT twice over and even with all its flaws in the later seasons it’s a certified top 3 show imo. although so many little things the writers did simply just annoys me. like why do the starks never mention rickon again? he was growing up there with them in season 1 wasn’t he? and what they did to benjen stark they just waisted him smh. and at the end there’s still endless waves of dothraki and unsullied even though they apparently got wiped in the long night but whatever. also how they made danny worst then cersei, little finger, and ramsey still shocks me.","season 1"
"20","Season 1 is great but probably the slowest season. 2-4 are fantastic. 5-8….draw your own conclusions.","season 1"
"21","I'd say you're lucky you watched it in one go, I watched each season again shortly before the next season, So season 1 then watched it again before season 2 release, Then 1 and 2 before season 3 , then 1,2 and 3 before 4 and so on until the end. It was sad to have put that much time in but it was my favourite show and the best thing I'd watched. to have it end like it did made it seem like a waste. I still enjoyed the earlier seasons and I'm currently rewatching them (Just finished s1) Struggling to motivate myself to get through them though.","season 1"
"22","I agree with you about having it being sent out to a proper authenticating service.  However. None of those signatures look identical in formation. There are scribbles. Some are neat some have large loops some small. Some with left hand leans some with right. 

To your last point. That doesn't matter much when did you get yours signed. When was this signed. If yours was signed in season 1 and this season 6 or vis versa there you go actors especially after getting into cons where the sign 3000 times a day change their signatures to accommodate. 

Source : watch pawn stars and then say hmmm make sense or say yeah as people evolve so doese their hand writing

The source only applies to the last point btw

Edit. Do me a favor since you must be a handwriting analyst too circle in corresponding color all those letters you mentioned. Please. Cause I can make out like maybe one or maybe a pair so please help me out.","season 1"
"23","I watched it live from season 2 and usually rewatched before each season until the last one came out… then I didn’t touch anything GOT related until this weekend, when I started a rewatch with my partner who also hadn’t watched since it ended because of the disappointment. Well we just finished season 1 and I’ve been loving it so far! The characters, the story and the world is all so interesting and rich still! Not sure how I’ll feel as it goes on but at least enjoying seeing it all again after so long. The first few seasons were so great and I do think the first at least holds up still :)","season 1"
"24","I rewatch up to around season 6, and then continue watching but tend to skip or fast forward through some of the worse scenes and skip some episodes here and there. The rewatchability is still there, and season 1-4 is some of the best telly.","season 1"
"25","It’s season 1, that was a pre-release poster","season 1"
"26","I do like the range between 500 to 2k depending on signatures and season. Season 1 would be worth more.","season 1"
"27","Granted, I didnt start this show early on, but I did not see Sean Bean anywhere near a press or even a fandom event the last few seasons. From my understanding, he did not really do anything for the show after season 1

He is a bit of a successful actor outside of this show.. Perhaps he was at these “events” promoting one of his many different projects","season 1"
"28","If you ask it to d&amp;d they surely will say they forgot how they had looked like in season 1 🙄","season 1"
"29","When did they even sign this? Sean Bean was only in season 1 and Natalie Dormer didn’t show up until season 2","season 1"
"30","Yes they are still worth watching. 

I read all the books before starting to watch them right before season 4 came out and I was a dedicated fan after that. Went to the concert (front row!) and everything. 
I am rewatching the entire series now with my boyfriend and we are currently in season 7. The one thing I didn't pick up on before-- and that had annoyed me when I first watched-- was that the subtle hints of foreshadowing in the dialogue had fallen away. In season 7 it's not so much foreshadowing as it is callbacks to season 1, which is making it more enjoyable this time around.

The boyfriend is loving this btw, and he doesn't understand why he was told to not watch it by people, so you should definitely go for it.","season 1"
"31","I’ve tried black sails but I just couldn’t really get into it. I’ve tried watching season 1 twice, but I can still barely remember what happens in it","season 1"
"32","She wanted to break the wheel. Her description of the wheel is spokes that go round and round vying for power. To take out the spokes means her on top with zero dissent. Her views around dissent and how she deals with it make up the bulk of her story in Maareen; those that did not love her dethroned her. It was only with Fire and Blood, stamping them out, burning the slavers ships (which is of note in itself; previously she had waged war in a way as to not flambe slaves, it is only after she follows through with her threats that Maareen is truely 'won') to force a peace.

When she arrived in Westeros she had a strong claim, 3 dragons (who were difficult to kill) , a complete army of unsullied slaves and the horde army in the Dothraki. She was in a comfortable position, she had that much firepower its easy to be content and wait. There wasn't anyone who couldn't actually threaten her.

By the end she was in a much weaker position had a single dragon, half her army, her claim was being questioned by those who wanted Jon on the throne, along with the fact her closest 'friends' (and I'd argue she never had any friends, Missandei and Grey worm were in their minds repaying a debt and planning their life after Daenerys) were gone, and Westeros has weapon advancements that threatened the last remaining dragon.

Visares introduces the Machiavellian concept of 'Who can rule without fear or love?' in season 1. Danys entire story explores this, the point in Essos isn't to show us Dany like freeing slaves so much (there's really no need for 5 seasons of that...)  , more her situation, she is ruling over two peoples one with extreme version of love and one with a more extreme dislike, how she handles and ultimately resolves this feed into the finale.

During S8 she becomes disillusioned with Westerosi people. She does not believe she will be accepted, or loved. Her weak position makes her act more rash - going for Kings landing so soon after the battle at Winterfell is a form of desperation because she feels her power slipping away. In Essos she had a hard enough time controlled a percent of the population who rebelled.

By the time she leaves Winterfell she is erratic, acting irrationally, paranoid and delusional because of her state and slipping power. Losing another dragon only makes this worse. She can not rule without fear or love and she decides fear it is.

Burning it all is a more effective fear than just removing one person in power. Like the masters she needs to teach them she is willing to go Fire and Blood. The masters surrenders once and what good did that do her? She knows taking and sitting on a throne isn't a guarantee of power, she's been there. Power resides where men believe it resides.

Otherwise, Daenerys other characterisations allowed her to do this. While she has an affinity for freeing the enslaved, she also believes herself to be a sort of divine being, a fair number of her speeches before Season 8 go a bit *manifest destiny,* much of her final speech to her followers are all things we'd heard before but didn't have the same context.  Her long list of titles and general narcissism is best displayed in the scene where she meets Jon snow and talks about how faith in herself kept her going because she is special *'This is Jon snow... hes King in the North'* works as comic relief because the former was so self important and grandiose.

In S6 she's speaking with Hizdahr at the fighting pits and it's a really good dialogue into how far she is willing to go and *why;*

Daenerys - one day your great city will return to the dirt as well

Hizdahr - At your command?

Daenerys -- If needs be.

Hizdahr - And how many will die to make that happen?

Daenerys - if it comes to that, they will have died for a good reason.

Hizdahr - those men think they are dying for a good reason

Daenerys - - Someone elses reason

Daenerys didn't really change. Her situation did and she decided that now needs be, justified to herself by those that are dying are dying for a good reason (her reason), which she has long believed but previously not required (in her mind) .. Ultimately her want for unrivalled conquest was more important to her than the lives of those people, that is the conflict in Dany. The tragedy is it wouldn't have happened without the WW and Jon saga, the scary thing is she was always capable of deciding needs must.","season 1"
"33","It is mostly good good. Not anywhere near season 1 but better than season 3 &amp; kinda on the same level of season 2.

Edit: Only 3 episodes are aired till now though. I saw the medieval world in the promo of this season.","season 1"
"34","Good suggestion, thanks! I think I will do that. I loved season 1 and somewhat enjoyed season 2 but just couldn't get into season 3 at all, even though I really wanted to","season 1"
"35","I've tried 3 times to finish season 1. I'm surprised to see anyone call it a masterpiece. Guess it's just not for me.","season 1"
"36","Cersei didn't understand her role because it was all a fraud from the beginning. To secure the future stability of the realm and your house, to bring up and raise the heirs of the 7 kingdoms, one who will one day bring up their own heirs is a heavy responsibility. Something Cersei wouldn't know anything about being that her husband was a usurper, her children bastards of incest and she just being a c\*nt. 

Aemma was part of a royal line that ruled and maintained the balance in the realms for generations and she understood her role in continuing that. Tywin himself in season 1 said that when everyone is rotting in the ground ""it's the family name that lives on"".

Daddy Otto will make sure Alicent knows that her place is underneath the King looking at the ceiling lol jk.","season 1"
"37","why not. like the books. and season 1 to 6.","season 1"
"38","I thought the small council scene after Queen Aemma died was well written and extremely well acted by Paddy Considine. 

But I see where your coming from in the Game of Thrones season 1 episode 1 you felt like the characters had known each other for years. The bond between Ned and Robert felt extremely real. And all the Stark Children felt like they had grown up together.

So far House of Dragon the only two characters I can say have that kind of in depth relationship was Daemon and King Viserys, but nowhere near the depth of Ned and Robert. But I’m really looking forward to the rest of the season of The House of The Dragon.","season 1"
"39","I agree, when I rewatch, I can see the budget constraints on the story on season 1 &amp; 2, but it seems like GOT got super popular after season 3 and season 4 they had a bigger budget and started acting on some of the things set up in earlier seasons, plus they were still using the books for the scripts.","season 1"
"40","Huh, I really liked it. I actually liked everything about the episode. The only thing that seems a bit off when you compare it to season 1 of GoT is how grand everything is. That arena looked sick compared to the pathetic wooden structure that Robert used during the hands tourney, but the set designs are insanely good now.","season 1"
"41","Echoing everyone else. Do yourself a favor and watch season 1. Calling it phenomenal would be an understatement.","season 1"
"42","Ever since the show was made, I think he slowly lost interest gradually as time went long, There hasn't been a new book since the start of the show. I might get what for saying this, but they should've waited for the entire books to be finished before they made a TV adaptation.  The show only really worked because they thrived off the books. If GoT was a D&amp;D invention, the show would've been canceled after season 1 in my honest opinion.","season 1"
"43","Yeah it's like he's supposed to be the Jaime Lannister of this show. Can't hate on him like I did season 1 Jaime.","season 1"
"44","All the events that happened were perfectly fine IMHO. Dany’s first impulse was always violence, or to burn everything in her wake. Her violent tendencies were foreshadowed early in season 1, she just always had advisors to reign in her murderous tendencies. 

It was just the speed that it happened that was hard to fathom. 7 seasons of subtle character arc that get thrown on its head in 2 episodes. 

Also The Long Night where everyone kept dying but coming back to life, and you couldn’t see anything, and Bran did nothing, and Euron killing a dragon, and ahh I fucking give up.","season 1"
"45","It's to attract the idiots, honestly. Just think of all the people who quit GoT Season 1 after the first episode because ""it was boring"".  


They're trying to pre-empt that this time around by having the characters more on the nose about their feelings and aspiriations, then giving the ""dont' worry more shit will happen!"" trailer afterwards.  


The problem, as always, is idiots.","season 1"
