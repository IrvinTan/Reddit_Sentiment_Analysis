"1","I second this. I watched shortly before season 8 came out and managed to not get spoiled until I found this sub while I was in like season 4 or 5","season 4"
"2","I neglected rewatching it for years, mostly because of how it ended. I would call the show’s conclusion the biggest pop culture tragedy in recent memory. But I had gotten over that and was gearing up for a rewatch, but still held off for about a year because just knowing that I was gonna have to relive moments like Ned’s death and everything just falling apart in general and the Red Wedding and god awful Cersei getting what she wants so often. I finally got over that recently and am in season 4. So the biggest hills other than the conclusion have been climbed. So many little moments and things that I forgot about. Such an amazing show while it was still good","season 4"
"3","I think its because Dexter seasons are more self contained. You could pretend season 4 is the last season and it kind of still works.

But GoT is more like one long story. If you stop at season 4 you'll be like what the heck is the point of Brans story, who is going to end up king, what kind of man is Jamie going to end up being etc etc. 

Since the whole series is building up and so dependent on the finals seasons, the final seasons ends up dragging down the earlier seasons moreso.","season 4"
"4","I just get annoyed, sure it's cool, but I only remember how GoT was botched after season 4. I saw that during the Dorne arc during season 5, sure there was some cool stuff but that couldn't make up for it. Every season I kept thinking that was bad but surely it can't get worse than that, but it always did, just worse and worse. D&amp;D will forever be a study on how to completely and entirely fuck up what could have been one of the all-time greatest shows.","season 4"
"5","I think GRRM was way too slow in writing.  The show was winging it after Season 4.","season 4"
"6","I wonder if the value of the picture went down after season 4 and less for each following season..","season 4"
"7","Just watch up to Season 4 and then repeat. Anything after that is not worth the time IMO.","season 4"
"8","I usually stop my binge at season 4 because of this. Maybe make it through season 5 as well because it definitely has it's moments, but that's only if I'm feeling it. I usually just pretend season 5-8 didn't happen and call it good. My problems is that the characters change so much in those later seasons. Tyrion becomes an idiot, Bran is just a robot that ends up taking over, Varys becomes powerless, I could go on but you get my point.","season 4"
"9","Faceless men techniques still include stealth movement and it was area which Arya knew really well.

And GoT sure had problems but some stuff that is bashed in bad season 8 is praised in other shows as badass. And when in season 4 Jon was losing to Karl fans cried that hero shouldnt be losing. 
Batman is just good example, everything he does is praised badass even though most of it is basic plot twists.","season 4"
"10","Yes they are still worth watching. 

I read all the books before starting to watch them right before season 4 came out and I was a dedicated fan after that. Went to the concert (front row!) and everything. 
I am rewatching the entire series now with my boyfriend and we are currently in season 7. The one thing I didn't pick up on before-- and that had annoyed me when I first watched-- was that the subtle hints of foreshadowing in the dialogue had fallen away. In season 7 it's not so much foreshadowing as it is callbacks to season 1, which is making it more enjoyable this time around.

The boyfriend is loving this btw, and he doesn't understand why he was told to not watch it by people, so you should definitely go for it.","season 4"
"11","Watch until season 4. These people are just being nice. Show dies after that","season 4"
"12","I’d say it depends. 

If you mainly watch GoT for the awesome battle sequences and really cool fight scenes then watch it until the end. 

If you love all the mind games, politics, and no plot armor, then I’d recommend stopping after Season 4. I watched until the end, and I wish I didn’t. The drop off in quality in storytelling and character arcs might be the greatest in the history of any story ever.","season 4"
"13","Gangrape at crasters keep in season 4, episode 4.","season 4"
"14","First off, might want to dispel the notion that her entire identity was about freeing slaves and realize that literally most of her screentime was spent pursuing power for herself. 

Seasons 1, 2, and the beginning of 3? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. Seasons 7 and 8? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. So 4.5 seasons of conquering versus less than 3 about freeing slaves (back half of Season 3, Season 4, Season 5, one episode in Season 6.. the clear minority.)

Her time in Slaver's Bay was a single arc, not some 'whole' identity. 

That said, I think a fresh and unbiased rewatch always helps paint a clearer picture of the issue. 

Season 8 completely implodes her world around her. If you see her psyche as a Jenga tower, it's easy to see how it becomes increasingly unstable throughout the final season until it is this unstable, teetering structure that finally topples over in an emotional moment. 

Her support structure crumbles (deaths, betrayals), her hopes and dreams and beliefs shattered (Jon's heritage reveal, she's not the Chosen One, Westeros doesn't love her) and her promising relationships all sour (killed, betrayed, Jon's romantic relationship ends.)

Keep in mind she's a young adult with a fucked-up upbringing (sold, raped, etc) with a Fire and Blood persona and family history of mental issues. Her entire world comes crashing down on her in a short amount of time, and this is a person who, has literally stated from her own mouth multiple times previously that she is capable/willing to raze entire cities if she feels the ends justify the means. 

She clearly states, in the latter episodes an increasingly deteriorated mental state, that she now sees the people of King's Landing as 'supporting' Cersei (ie, enemies) and that she has decided to ""Rule by Fear.""

Then, once she sees the Red Keep, that Jenga tower that's been teetering on a single piece because of all the other pieces that once held it in place are missing, finally topples over, and that Fire and Blood persona that's been bubbling up all this time is finally unleashed in full force. 

Wish we could have gleaned more context from the scene if we could have seen her as she razed part of King's Landing, but unfortunately we didn't get to see her again until the aftermath in the next episode.","season 4"
"15","Was season 4 good? I lost all interest half way through season 2.","season 4"
"16","It comes down to George and D&amp;D (Dan and Dave) having creative differences. They (D&amp;D) were confident that they could do it in 7.5 seasons, but George wanted 10-13 seasons and had already started to divorce himself from the show around Season 4-5 because of this so he could focus on finishing the books and developing the spinoff source material. He finished writing Fire and Blood, the source material for HotD, in this time. 

George gave Dan and Dave bullet points of how the story would end, which is why they essentially gave you the items from his list, and they utterly lack the ability to get from point A to point C by gracefully going from A to B to C letter to letter, instead they thought they could kind of forget B and slap dash it together from A right to C.","season 4"
"17","Everybody keeps talking about how the last season was shit. Has everyone been taking crazy pills? The show was bad after season 4 when DnD ran out of books. It only got worse for the final season.","season 4"
"18","I think it opened a lot bigger than stranger things season 4","season 4"
"19","I agree, when I rewatch, I can see the budget constraints on the story on season 1 &amp; 2, but it seems like GOT got super popular after season 3 and season 4 they had a bigger budget and started acting on some of the things set up in earlier seasons, plus they were still using the books for the scripts.","season 4"
"20","My advice would be watch till at least the end of season 4. I mean watch it all but if you’re having doubts stick it out through 4","season 4"
"21","Stuck with it. Season 4 is back to greatness.","season 4"
"22","Is it worth watching season 4 without watching season 3?","season 4"
