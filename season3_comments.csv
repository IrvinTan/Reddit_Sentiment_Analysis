"6","&gt;Daenerys suddenly going mad and killing people when her whole thing is empowerment and freedom of the people.

Except Dany's ""whole thing"" is not empowerment and freedom of the people.. that was just an arc she had for a few seasons... from the middle of Season 3 to the end of Season 5... that's it. Maybe 25 episodes out of 70+. 

Seasons 1, 2, the start of 3, 7 and 8 are all about her conquest for the Iron Throne... the majority of the show. 

Sure, Dany deserves mad props for her actions in Slaver's Bay, but people need to stop pretending like that was her entire character, as it completely undermines/downplays her very clearly established Fire and Blood persona and personal desire for this grand political power. 

It seems clear that people tend to overblow the aspects about characters they admire (like Dany and Jaime) and seemingly handwave/overlook their negative aspects, despite being rather plainly displayed on-screen for all to see. 

&gt;Jamie joining Cerci and the two die by rocks falling when there was a prophecy that said she would die by her brother's hand (and though she always thought it would be Tyrion, the Kingslayer was being built to become the Queen slayer).

The Valonquar prophecy is not show canon though, sorry. Would have been interesting to see, for sure, but it seemed pretty clear they weren't going to go that route considering they made the effort to edit that portion of the prophecy out of the show.","season 3"
"7","Dany and Jamie scenes.

Some viewers sure love to whinge about how those character arcs ended, but seemingly tend to forget/are unaware that their actions/choices in the end absolutely have had the groundwork laid for them across their entire arc leading up to Season 8.

Some people, over time, seemingly placed these two characters on some pedestal where only some grand animated Disney resolution would suffice, but, on-screen, these characters are portrayed as gray characters capable of both great and terrible acts, often based on both great and terrible choices.

Dany so often shows this Fire and Blood persona throughout her arc (as her advisors constantly tell her to tone it down) and her relationship with *power* becomes an increasingly suspect one, as when she doesn't have it she curses those who abuse it, but then as she gains power seemingly abuses it herself. Her whole arc is a series of hypocritical words/acts mixed with this fiery persona building up to a boiling point as her world comes crashing down upon her during her time in Westeros.

Also, people love to claim that her ""entire story"" revolved around helping the innocent, but that wasn't really the case, as it was a temporary goal of hers from midway in Season 3 (she literally went to Slaver's Bay in order to specifically purchase fighting slaves) to the end of Season 5 (when she rides off on Drogon.) That's it... aside from one single episode in Season 6, so maybe 25 episodes out of 70+. It's a nice arc, and certainly helps show off one side to her character (that many fans latched onto) but hardly an ""entire story"" as tends to get parroted. She spends Seasons 1, 2, half of 3, 7 and 8 trying to win the Iron Throne for herself... clearly a majority of her on-screen time.

As for Jaime, he so clearly has this soft spot for Cersei and literal life-long bond with her that I'm surprised so many people were gobsmacked by his decision. He literally spends 7+ seasons doing anything/everything for her while not giving two fucks about anyone not named Lannister (or Brienne), but people seemingly are surprised that he went back to her simply because he slept with someone else once over 40+ years? And are surprised that he stated that he didn't care about people, despite it being pretty obvious for 7+ seasons that he didn't care about people. I mean, there are specific scenes when he is with Cersei when he literally states that he doesn't care about anyone else, but somehow people think their own personal head canon/interpretation of the bath scene magically supercedes what he literally states on-screen about the commonfolk.

I honestly believe if you review these two characters with an open mind and fresh eyes, that Season 8 is not ""as bad"" as many people claim. Sure, the last seasons will always be a bit rough, but I think having a unbiased understanding of these two characters will help anyone understand how these two arcs end by shedding a neutral light on how these characters got to this point.","season 3"
"8","&gt;She sentenced the Tarley's because they brought down their liege Lord's house, which was loyal to Daenerys.  She gave them an out; bend the knee or take the Black.  Tarley declined both and  died for it.

Except this is mostly fiction. 

I realize people have parroted this nonsense so much that some people actually believe it, but Dany never offers them the Black. 

Tyrion merely mentions it as an idea... which obviously is not the same as Dany offering it. 

She starts her spiel with 'serve me or die', never agrees to anything Tyrion offers, then finished her spiel by executing them for refusing to serve. 

She clearly never wavers on her ""serve me or die"" stance, and she clearly never offers them the Black. 

Those are the facts, hence that is the show canon. 

&gt;\&gt; It only occurred to me now that in the midst of shitty writing aimed to have Daenerys go mad, her side never offered an ultimatum to Cersei. 

It would have been interesting to see that, sure, but not it's not really out of character for Dany to retaliate in a *Fire and Blood* manner, considering how she reacts to when she/her allies are attacked, like when Selmy was killed. Would have been interesting to see Tyrion try and offer her this option, and see that anger in her that we've seen time and time again seek blood instead of peace as she shoots him down and chooses to attack.  

&gt;\&gt; As for Essos, the ones she freed were allowed to leave or follow her. She did this because her primary want was to free slaves. The Unsullied, she needed, but let make the choice anyway.

OK, so can we agree that her primary goal in Westeros, based on her actions here, was *not* to help the oppressed then? Based on her actions here compared to those back in Astapor, clearly she is not concerned with these people like she was with the Unsullied... is that fair to say?  

All of these POWs were forced to fight against their will, else be accused of Treason/executed, not unlike the Unsullied were... so if she is the ""same"" as she was in Season 3, shouldn't she offer them a similar choice? 

Does she not know that these people are being forced to fight? Sure, these POWs aren't slaves per se, but this situation is not wholly different from that in Astapor, **as these people are being ordered to fight for someone else under threat of death.** 

Aren't these literally the people she promised to help? Is she not aware that these people... *her subjects.*.. aren't really her enemies? 

She makes the very clear choice to subjugate them in some tyrannical act by forcing them to serve her or be killed. 

Would have been interesting had she actually offered them the Black, but that is not show canon... merely some biased fabrication formed in the echo chamber that is this subreddit.","season 3"
"9","It's simple... because she is the most hypocritical character portrayed within the show.

Just look at the examples:

When a captive of the Dothraki kills a Khal, she sees them as wrong and executes them for their actions... but later she herself, when captured by the Dothraki decides to kill the Khals.

She executes Mossador for taking matters into his own hands for killing a slaver outside of ""court"", but later after Selmy is killed has zero problems just executing a slaver outside of ""court"", regardless of innocence/guilt even.

Complains about being forced to marry for political gain... then forces a wrongfully imprisoned prisoner to marry her for her own political gain when it suits her agenda.

Is upset in Astapor that people are inhumanely executing for refusing to serve... later executes people who refuse to serve her in Westeros.

When she believes she has the rightful claim to the throne it is all important and she expects everyone to literally bow before her and hand her ships just because of her title... when it is discovered Jon is the rightful heir suddenly the ""rightful heir"" tag is completely meaningless in regards to who should sit on the Iron Throne and she still wants the throne for herself anyways.

Claims rulers in Westeros are corrupt/evil for what they do, then she does the exact same nonsense when she's in power... threatening Jon in regards to bending the knee , executing Tarleys for refusing to kneel, subjugating POWs through fear, etc.

I do think there's a very clear shift in her from Seasons 3 to Season 7. As you stated, in Season 3 she has people follow her because they believe in her message because her message is a just one, but in Season 7 she uses fear and power to subjugate people to follow her, like the Crown POWs and Jon

Season 3: allows the people she's freed to choose their own path.

Season 7: subjugates her subjects through fear and threat of execution.

It's a shift in her character that a lot of viewers seemingly overlooked/hand-waved away, but at the end of the day it seems fairly clear that she's just a hypocrite who hates the system when looking at it at a distance from the outside, but has zero problems abusing it to her personal gain when it benefits her.

Basically she claims she's all about free choice, but then burns anyone who doesn't agree with her.","season 3"
"10","&gt;These are not the actions of someone who does not care about people except for Cersei.

But they are. 

You act like his actions are on par with Dany Seasons 3-6... which is absolutely absurd, because they absolutely are not. 

From Seasons 1-7.999, outside of his growing bond with Brienne, everything he does is either for himself, for Cersei, or to grow Lannister power. Perpetrating war. Killing/threatening innocents multiple times. Siding with Cersei after he knows she blew up the Sept, etc. He shows less than zero interest in the commonfolk. For 7 seasons. 

Literally says as much on-screen multiple times... that 'he only cares about himself and Cersei' or he would massacre everyone in Riverrun just to get back to Cersei, ethc. 

Even going North is about him and his honor... not that he actually believes an over-the-hill one-handed fighter is magically going to save the people. 

&gt;\&gt; Even that is a punch in the face because he at least had the honor to be faithful to Cersie and not lay with any other women. I understand there are a lot of vows but he seems to be very selective in which vows are more important than others.

OK. He stated his stance on vows when speaking with Catelyn, so feel like we knew this way back in Season 3. 

&gt;\&gt; Undo might be a bit of a strong word, fuck up might be more accurate because now when you watch those scenes in the context of the entire series it just makes me feel like the writers, not the character, are lying to you.

Except it's not a 'fuck-up'... it's an intentional choice by the original writer... wild that some people still can't understand this.  

Sorry that you feel that way, but that's something you're going to have to deal with yourself, as there's nothing inherently wrong with having a character ""fall off the wagon."" It's a realistic character choice for this character, who so obviously has this bond with Cersei, to make. There's nothing *wrong* with it. 

Don't like it? That's the point... but doesn't inherently make it ""bad"" or ""wrong"" or ""character assassination"" like some viewers try and claim. 

Most every character got a relatively happy ending... it's unfair to focus on the ones who did not and whinge ad naseum because you didn't like it.","season 3"
"11","I'd say you're lucky you watched it in one go, I watched each season again shortly before the next season, So season 1 then watched it again before season 2 release, Then 1 and 2 before season 3 , then 1,2 and 3 before 4 and so on until the end. It was sad to have put that much time in but it was my favourite show and the best thing I'd watched. to have it end like it did made it seem like a waste. I still enjoyed the earlier seasons and I'm currently rewatching them (Just finished s1) Struggling to motivate myself to get through them though.","season 3"

"14","First off, might want to dispel the notion that her entire identity was about freeing slaves and realize that literally most of her screentime was spent pursuing power for herself. 

Seasons 1, 2, and the beginning of 3? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. Seasons 7 and 8? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. So 4.5 seasons of conquering versus less than 3 about freeing slaves (back half of Season 3, Season 4, Season 5, one episode in Season 6.. the clear minority.)

Her time in Slaver's Bay was a single arc, not some 'whole' identity. 

That said, I think a fresh and unbiased rewatch always helps paint a clearer picture of the issue. 

Season 8 completely implodes her world around her. If you see her psyche as a Jenga tower, it's easy to see how it becomes increasingly unstable throughout the final season until it is this unstable, teetering structure that finally topples over in an emotional moment. 

Her support structure crumbles (deaths, betrayals), her hopes and dreams and beliefs shattered (Jon's heritage reveal, she's not the Chosen One, Westeros doesn't love her) and her promising relationships all sour (killed, betrayed, Jon's romantic relationship ends.)

Keep in mind she's a young adult with a fucked-up upbringing (sold, raped, etc) with a Fire and Blood persona and family history of mental issues. Her entire world comes crashing down on her in a short amount of time, and this is a person who, has literally stated from her own mouth multiple times previously that she is capable/willing to raze entire cities if she feels the ends justify the means. 

She clearly states, in the latter episodes an increasingly deteriorated mental state, that she now sees the people of King's Landing as 'supporting' Cersei (ie, enemies) and that she has decided to ""Rule by Fear.""

Then, once she sees the Red Keep, that Jenga tower that's been teetering on a single piece because of all the other pieces that once held it in place are missing, finally topples over, and that Fire and Blood persona that's been bubbling up all this time is finally unleashed in full force. 

Wish we could have gleaned more context from the scene if we could have seen her as she razed part of King's Landing, but unfortunately we didn't get to see her again until the aftermath in the next episode.","season 3"
