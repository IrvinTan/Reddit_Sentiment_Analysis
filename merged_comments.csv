This is not how they get past the Wall. They get past the Wall by tearing it down with a big Ice Dragon. The mark just means he knows where Bran is. 

I don't think it's true either they get past the Wall when they attack Mormont and Jon in Season 1.

Bran being dead doesn't stop the Beyond the Wall Dany losing her dragon plot. They could've also just incorporated the Horn of Joramun in that they'd left out of the show.","season 1"
"12","I mean I have a literature degree so I do feel I get where you're coming from but I think it just needed more time. Jaime definitely is a tragic character, with his tragic flaw being his weakness to his sister, but it wasn't really clear why he went back to her at THAT particular moment? Like one moment he's riding away from her to go off north, the next he's decided to return to her... but what was the internal journey between those points?

Contrast that with Ned's downfall in season 1; it was shocking for most viewers but it ""made sense""; he had clearly made mistakes within the rules of the world, and he was punished for it. It was surprising but not unsatisfying.","season 1"

These were originally published as non-spoilery jumping-on points for new readers between the early novels, and you can read them whenever you like. Some D&amp;E elements are referenced in the later novels as Easter eggs (and may also be clues towards/set up important historical stuff), especially in AFFC onwards:

2. “The Sworn Sword”, originally in _Legends II_ anthology
3. “The Mystery Knight”, originally in _Warriors_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois

Prequel fake history books, written in the style of a maester recounting and commenting upon past events:

1. _Fire &amp; Blood_, covering approximately half the time since the Targaryen Conquest 300 years before ASOIAF. Parts of this have previously appearead as the following novellas which were originally published in anthologies (mostly minor changes, “The Princess and the Queen” is the most expanded). NB: this starts straight at the Conquest and doesn't cover the situation leading up to it, which you'd have to get from TWOIAF if you're interested:

	a. “Sons of the Dragon” with Aegon the Conqueror's heirs, originally in _The Book of Swords_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois  
	b. “The Princess and the Queen”, rivalry of Rhaenyra and Alicent which will be part of House of the Dragon show, originally in _Dangerous Women_ anthology  
	c. “The Rogue Prince”, some events of TPATQ focusing on Daemon Targaryen, originally in _Rogues_ anthology

Prequel fake history books that are tie-in supplements:

1. _The World of Ice and Fire_, heavily illustrated lorebook/artbook, with the first half giving a history from the earliest prehistorical times, then the Conquest and the reigns of all the Targaryen rulers up until just before Robert's Rebellion more than a decade before the start of ASOIAF. The back half gives regional histories for all Seven Kingdoms, plus the lands of Essos and beyond. Only parts of it are written by GRRM (as sidebars from “Maester Gyldayn”), the rest written up by his co-authors from his notes.  
  
  NB: there's a couple of spoilers for particular major events from AGOT through ASOS in the fake intro and the fake outro, so you may choose to skip reading those parts until you've finished those novels (and maybe also Dunk &amp; Egg since some of the history chapters give away the fates of certain guest characters), but otherwise pretty much everything else in it won't involve details of the main series storylines.
2. upcoming _The Rise of the Dragon_, again mostly done by GRRM's co-authors, basically a rewrite of parts of F&amp;B into a more encyclopedic style like TWOIAF, lavishly illustrated with new art

Other supplementary books:

- _The Lands of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in book of foldout maps showing all the regions in more detail and full colour, nice to have, but note necessary
- _A Feast of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in cookbook with recipes based on the series, foreword by GRRM
- _The Wit and Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister_, just quotes from the books, with a few cartoony illustrations, IMHO not worth it unless you find it in a bargain discount bin and are morbidly curious
- “A World of Ice and Fire” official tie-in app for Android &amp; iOS devices, done by the TWOIAF co-authors. Wiki-style mini-encyclopedia of characters and places throughout the books with illustrations taken from other official tie-ins, with a slider that can be set per-book (paid content) to avoid spoilers. Apparently has some trivia tidbits not found in TWOIAF and the official fansite's wiki, taken from GRRM's notes. The free section has the entirety of the entries for the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas, as well as several but not all of the TWOW sample chapters released so far (easiest way to read most of them, IMHO), and a few more sample chapters from TWOIAF, and sample maps from TLOAIF.

Not a tie-in, even though the back copy advertises it as such:

- “The Ice Dragon”, a novella set in an entirely different fantasy universe, but some of whose ideas were speculated to have been used in Season 7 and might be relevant to future novels, available reprinted in _Dreamsongs_ and in a standalone illustrated hardcover/ebook edition.
- you may also come across mention of “Blood of the Dragon”, “Path of the Dragon”, and “The Arms of the Kraken”. These are just novellas compiled from selected POV chapters from the ASOIAF novels, repackaged into a storyline following just the one character as a promo.

Bonus editions with extras:

AGOT through ASOS are currently available in rather nice The Illustrated Edition anniversary hardcovers with artwork depicting characters and events (there are also other licensed illustrated editions from specialty publishers with different art, but these are the more common and affordable ones from Penguin Random House &amp; HarperCollins Voyager).

And the entire series so far is also available in a very nice The Enhanced Edition for Mac/iOS devices from the Apple iTunes Store, which has handy features showing a map of where each character is at the start of their chapter (taken from _The Lands of Ice and Fire_ mapbook), a recap of what happened in the last, a character glossary recapping what happened to them in previous books, some artwork and sample passages read from the audiobooks, and some footnotes giving worldbuilding background details and trivia tidbits (mostly pulled from interview quotes and GRRM's notes given to his helpers).

All the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas are available in a graphic novel adaptation if you like comics, and so are AGOT and ACOK in collected editions (ASOS is apparently also being done, but currently unfinished).

Hope this helps!","season 1"
"14","Ruined the show for me. I would rewatch it all the time. I probably saw season 1 10-15 times. Ever since the finale I haven’t had the urge to rewatch a single episode.","season 1"
"15","I still like season 1-7 and most of 8 it’s watchable and a good time. I still think there’s a difference in making a bad decision but that decision being based on the characters development compared to this is a twist thats more like how exciting. Jamie’s I can see where it came from but when he decided to go north, it should have been to save Cersi, not because he gave his word. When he went north the character developed was going in the way of honour something that through the show we see him struggling with. Yes he can go back on honour for his love but the writing needs to be in a way that makes it a big deal. It felt like I’m going back to Cersi and all I cared about was poor Brienne. 

So Danerys arc and development she kills evil people, so slavers ect. But the slavers she killed hanged corpses on crosses so quite evil. The sons of harpy killed her friends army and devastated the city. But no there’s innocent people their so I’m not going to kill everyone. What’s even better here is it didn’t even come up as an option. 

So then ok we want drama yes drama is good but how do we get drama true to her character is here good writing comes into it. So yes I want more then ooooo she snapped and burnt the city.

One of the best mistakes a character made was Cersi restoring the faith militant, which was very much to her character and made for great writing.","season 1"
"16","&gt;Jamie and Danerys arc annoyed me the most. 

I mean, that's the whole point of this gritty drama... we've watched it for 7+ years because it is this no nold barred experience that is ruthless and unapologetic. This is not some animated Disney film where all your favorite characters live happily ever after, and expecting as much seems incredibly naive.

We're supposed to be disappointed by the decisions that Dany and Jaime make, because they are humans conflicted within their own hearts. 

I actually think that if everyone just makes all the best decisions for themselves in the final seasons, it would feel incredibly hollow, fake, and unfitting for this show where the main character loses his head in the very first season because of a series of poor choices on his part... but that doesn't mean Season 1 is bad simply because a character we liked has a somber ending to his story.","season 1"
"17","Jamie and Danerys arc annoyed me the most. We spent years getting growth out of them for her to turn into her brother from season 1, and Jamie to go fuck it I’ll have a boring fight and completely regress as a character. Also with Jamie it ruins the completion of Cersi who should have died alone once she’s pushed everyone away. I also like the night king ep, but it’s chaotic which it should be but I feel not in a good way now that I’ve watched it again. I would have liked more then one episode about him finally crossing the wall and attacking. I also don’t understand her saying she’s going to conquer the rest of the 7 kingdoms, when John rules the north so that’s hers, the south and iron isles are hers and everyone else is dead.","season 1"
"18","Dany was definitely a main character, but she wasn't THE main character. And she was definitely built up as a villain all the way from season 1. Remember, her first instinct to solve problems was always to use fire and blood. The audience just didn't mind because she killed murderers and slavers and rapers. But through that she got the belief that she was right and when she came to Westeros she was unwilling to change her mind. This leads to her followers either becoming as fanatic as her or starting to doubt her (which leads her down a paranoia path). And then there is the fact that she is a Targaryen, and as the saying goes, every time a Targaryen is born the gods flip a coin. Dany's coin definitely landed on the wrong side, people just refused to see it.","season 1"
"19","i’ve seen GoT twice over and even with all its flaws in the later seasons it’s a certified top 3 show imo. although so many little things the writers did simply just annoys me. like why do the starks never mention rickon again? he was growing up there with them in season 1 wasn’t he? and what they did to benjen stark they just waisted him smh. and at the end there’s still endless waves of dothraki and unsullied even though they apparently got wiped in the long night but whatever. also how they made danny worst then cersei, little finger, and ramsey still shocks me.","season 1"
"20","Season 1 is great but probably the slowest season. 2-4 are fantastic. 5-8….draw your own conclusions.","season 1"
"21","I'd say you're lucky you watched it in one go, I watched each season again shortly before the next season, So season 1 then watched it again before season 2 release, Then 1 and 2 before season 3 , then 1,2 and 3 before 4 and so on until the end. It was sad to have put that much time in but it was my favourite show and the best thing I'd watched. to have it end like it did made it seem like a waste. I still enjoyed the earlier seasons and I'm currently rewatching them (Just finished s1) Struggling to motivate myself to get through them though.","season 1"
"22","I agree with you about having it being sent out to a proper authenticating service.  However. None of those signatures look identical in formation. There are scribbles. Some are neat some have large loops some small. Some with left hand leans some with right. 

To your last point. That doesn't matter much when did you get yours signed. When was this signed. If yours was signed in season 1 and this season 6 or vis versa there you go actors especially after getting into cons where the sign 3000 times a day change their signatures to accommodate. 

Source : watch pawn stars and then say hmmm make sense or say yeah as people evolve so doese their hand writing

The source only applies to the last point btw

Edit. Do me a favor since you must be a handwriting analyst too circle in corresponding color all those letters you mentioned. Please. Cause I can make out like maybe one or maybe a pair so please help me out.","season 1"
"23","I watched it live from season 2 and usually rewatched before each season until the last one came out… then I didn’t touch anything GOT related until this weekend, when I started a rewatch with my partner who also hadn’t watched since it ended because of the disappointment. Well we just finished season 1 and I’ve been loving it so far! The characters, the story and the world is all so interesting and rich still! Not sure how I’ll feel as it goes on but at least enjoying seeing it all again after so long. The first few seasons were so great and I do think the first at least holds up still :)","season 1"
"24","I rewatch up to around season 6, and then continue watching but tend to skip or fast forward through some of the worse scenes and skip some episodes here and there. The rewatchability is still there, and season 1-4 is some of the best telly.","season 1"

"27","Granted, I didnt start this show early on, but I did not see Sean Bean anywhere near a press or even a fandom event the last few seasons. From my understanding, he did not really do anything for the show after season 1

He is a bit of a successful actor outside of this show.. Perhaps he was at these “events” promoting one of his many different projects","season 1"
"28","If you ask it to d&amp;d they surely will say they forgot how they had looked like in season 1 🙄","season 1"
"29","When did they even sign this? Sean Bean was only in season 1 and Natalie Dormer didn’t show up until season 2","season 1"
"30","Yes they are still worth watching. 

I read all the books before starting to watch them right before season 4 came out and I was a dedicated fan after that. Went to the concert (front row!) and everything. 
I am rewatching the entire series now with my boyfriend and we are currently in season 7. The one thing I didn't pick up on before-- and that had annoyed me when I first watched-- was that the subtle hints of foreshadowing in the dialogue had fallen away. In season 7 it's not so much foreshadowing as it is callbacks to season 1, which is making it more enjoyable this time around.

The boyfriend is loving this btw, and he doesn't understand why he was told to not watch it by people, so you should definitely go for it.","season 1"
"31","I’ve tried black sails but I just couldn’t really get into it. I’ve tried watching season 1 twice, but I can still barely remember what happens in it","season 1"
"32","She wanted to break the wheel. Her description of the wheel is spokes that go round and round vying for power. To take out the spokes means her on top with zero dissent. Her views around dissent and how she deals with it make up the bulk of her story in Maareen; those that did not love her dethroned her. It was only with Fire and Blood, stamping them out, burning the slavers ships (which is of note in itself; previously she had waged war in a way as to not flambe slaves, it is only after she follows through with her threats that Maareen is truely 'won') to force a peace.

When she arrived in Westeros she had a strong claim, 3 dragons (who were difficult to kill) , a complete army of unsullied slaves and the horde army in the Dothraki. She was in a comfortable position, she had that much firepower its easy to be content and wait. There wasn't anyone who couldn't actually threaten her.

By the end she was in a much weaker position had a single dragon, half her army, her claim was being questioned by those who wanted Jon on the throne, along with the fact her closest 'friends' (and I'd argue she never had any friends, Missandei and Grey worm were in their minds repaying a debt and planning their life after Daenerys) were gone, and Westeros has weapon advancements that threatened the last remaining dragon.

Visares introduces the Machiavellian concept of 'Who can rule without fear or love?' in season 1. Danys entire story explores this, the point in Essos isn't to show us Dany like freeing slaves so much (there's really no need for 5 seasons of that...)  , more her situation, she is ruling over two peoples one with extreme version of love and one with a more extreme dislike, how she handles and ultimately resolves this feed into the finale.

During S8 she becomes disillusioned with Westerosi people. She does not believe she will be accepted, or loved. Her weak position makes her act more rash - going for Kings landing so soon after the battle at Winterfell is a form of desperation because she feels her power slipping away. In Essos she had a hard enough time controlled a percent of the population who rebelled.

By the time she leaves Winterfell she is erratic, acting irrationally, paranoid and delusional because of her state and slipping power. Losing another dragon only makes this worse. She can not rule without fear or love and she decides fear it is.

Burning it all is a more effective fear than just removing one person in power. Like the masters she needs to teach them she is willing to go Fire and Blood. The masters surrenders once and what good did that do her? She knows taking and sitting on a throne isn't a guarantee of power, she's been there. Power resides where men believe it resides.

Otherwise, Daenerys other characterisations allowed her to do this. While she has an affinity for freeing the enslaved, she also believes herself to be a sort of divine being, a fair number of her speeches before Season 8 go a bit *manifest destiny,* much of her final speech to her followers are all things we'd heard before but didn't have the same context.  Her long list of titles and general narcissism is best displayed in the scene where she meets Jon snow and talks about how faith in herself kept her going because she is special *'This is Jon snow... hes King in the North'* works as comic relief because the former was so self important and grandiose.

In S6 she's speaking with Hizdahr at the fighting pits and it's a really good dialogue into how far she is willing to go and *why;*

Daenerys - one day your great city will return to the dirt as well

Hizdahr - At your command?

Daenerys -- If needs be.

Hizdahr - And how many will die to make that happen?

Daenerys - if it comes to that, they will have died for a good reason.

Hizdahr - those men think they are dying for a good reason

Daenerys - - Someone elses reason

Daenerys didn't really change. Her situation did and she decided that now needs be, justified to herself by those that are dying are dying for a good reason (her reason), which she has long believed but previously not required (in her mind) .. Ultimately her want for unrivalled conquest was more important to her than the lives of those people, that is the conflict in Dany. The tragedy is it wouldn't have happened without the WW and Jon saga, the scary thing is she was always capable of deciding needs must.","season 1"
"33","It is mostly good good. Not anywhere near season 1 but better than season 3 &amp; kinda on the same level of season 2.

Edit: Only 3 episodes are aired till now though. I saw the medieval world in the promo of this season.","season 1"
"34","Good suggestion, thanks! I think I will do that. I loved season 1 and somewhat enjoyed season 2 but just couldn't get into season 3 at all, even though I really wanted to","season 1"
"35","I've tried 3 times to finish season 1. I'm surprised to see anyone call it a masterpiece. Guess it's just not for me.","season 1"
"36","Cersei didn't understand her role because it was all a fraud from the beginning. To secure the future stability of the realm and your house, to bring up and raise the heirs of the 7 kingdoms, one who will one day bring up their own heirs is a heavy responsibility. Something Cersei wouldn't know anything about being that her husband was a usurper, her children bastards of incest and she just being a c\*nt. 

Aemma was part of a royal line that ruled and maintained the balance in the realms for generations and she understood her role in continuing that. Tywin himself in season 1 said that when everyone is rotting in the ground ""it's the family name that lives on"".

Daddy Otto will make sure Alicent knows that her place is underneath the King looking at the ceiling lol jk.","season 1"
"37","why not. like the books. and season 1 to 6.","season 1"
"38","I thought the small council scene after Queen Aemma died was well written and extremely well acted by Paddy Considine. 

But I see where your coming from in the Game of Thrones season 1 episode 1 you felt like the characters had known each other for years. The bond between Ned and Robert felt extremely real. And all the Stark Children felt like they had grown up together.

So far House of Dragon the only two characters I can say have that kind of in depth relationship was Daemon and King Viserys, but nowhere near the depth of Ned and Robert. But I’m really looking forward to the rest of the season of The House of The Dragon.","season 1"
"39","I agree, when I rewatch, I can see the budget constraints on the story on season 1 &amp; 2, but it seems like GOT got super popular after season 3 and season 4 they had a bigger budget and started acting on some of the things set up in earlier seasons, plus they were still using the books for the scripts.","season 1"
"40","Huh, I really liked it. I actually liked everything about the episode. The only thing that seems a bit off when you compare it to season 1 of GoT is how grand everything is. That arena looked sick compared to the pathetic wooden structure that Robert used during the hands tourney, but the set designs are insanely good now.","season 1"
"41","Echoing everyone else. Do yourself a favor and watch season 1. Calling it phenomenal would be an understatement.","season 1"
"42","Ever since the show was made, I think he slowly lost interest gradually as time went long, There hasn't been a new book since the start of the show. I might get what for saying this, but they should've waited for the entire books to be finished before they made a TV adaptation.  The show only really worked because they thrived off the books. If GoT was a D&amp;D invention, the show would've been canceled after season 1 in my honest opinion.","season 1"
"43","Yeah it's like he's supposed to be the Jaime Lannister of this show. Can't hate on him like I did season 1 Jaime.","season 1"
"44","All the events that happened were perfectly fine IMHO. Dany’s first impulse was always violence, or to burn everything in her wake. Her violent tendencies were foreshadowed early in season 1, she just always had advisors to reign in her murderous tendencies. 

It was just the speed that it happened that was hard to fathom. 7 seasons of subtle character arc that get thrown on its head in 2 episodes. 

Also The Long Night where everyone kept dying but coming back to life, and you couldn’t see anything, and Bran did nothing, and Euron killing a dragon, and ahh I fucking give up.","season 1"
"45","It's to attract the idiots, honestly. Just think of all the people who quit GoT Season 1 after the first episode because ""it was boring"".  


They're trying to pre-empt that this time around by having the characters more on the nose about their feelings and aspiriations, then giving the ""dont' worry more shit will happen!"" trailer afterwards.  


The problem, as always, is idiots.","season 1"
"46","Phew...reading this tread reminds me of just how many great scenes this show has. I found myself agreeing to nearly all off them.

One underrated early favourite of mine is in season 2, when Sam, Grenn and the Dolorous are beyond the wall and the third horn blast is heard for the first time. Chills.","season 2"

AGOT through ASOS are currently available in rather nice The Illustrated Edition anniversary hardcovers with artwork depicting characters and events (there are also other licensed illustrated editions from specialty publishers with different art, but these are the more common and affordable ones from Penguin Random House &amp; HarperCollins Voyager).

And the entire series so far is also available in a very nice The Enhanced Edition for Mac/iOS devices from the Apple iTunes Store, which has handy features showing a map of where each character is at the start of their chapter (taken from _The Lands of Ice and Fire_ mapbook), a recap of what happened in the last, a character glossary recapping what happened to them in previous books, some artwork and sample passages read from the audiobooks, and some footnotes giving worldbuilding background details and trivia tidbits (mostly pulled from interview quotes and GRRM's notes given to his helpers).

All the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas are available in a graphic novel adaptation if you like comics, and so are AGOT and ACOK in collected editions (ASOS is apparently also being done, but currently unfinished).

"49","&gt;She locked up her dragons because it crisped one child.

Counterpoint: She was going to raze all of Astapor and Yunkai... innocents and thousands of children and all... because she was super pissed.

Like, I get it... she absolutely has a kind-hearted side... no one is denying that. She did amazing things all across Essos. This Kind-Hearted persona is a part of her character no doubt... check.

But the point that the story makes is that she also possesses this Fire and Blood persona, which is just as valid as a part of her character as her Kind-Hearted persona... and these two personas create this conflict within her.

&gt;\&gt; It just kinda appeared out of nowhere the whole I wanna burn everyone...

Absolutely not true. This is nothing new for her, as she very clearly has shown a willingness/capacity to raze entire cities multiple times... and as early as early Season 2.

Qarth. Astapor. Yunkai. Mereen. Has literally, on-screen, clearly stated a willingness/desire/capacity to raze each and every one of those cities.

Hell, Tyrion literally had to stop her, on-screen, from committing genocide across two entire cities back in Essos.

Absolutely not *""kind of appeared out of nowhere"".*.. at least not to those with an unbiased viewpoint of her character.

&gt;\&gt; Maybe it’s a problem with how I see the characters.

I think everyone should revisit the story and try to do so with fresh eyes, with an unbiased viewpoint. Try to see what is actually portrayed on-screen, and try to view these issues from other POVs and not just through the lens of the characters you love most.

It's easy to excuse a character's actions when you always see their actions and choices through their specific lens, but revisiting the story from a different or more neutral perspective helps to flesh out their actions instead of painting it with a pre-conceived biased perspective.

I think this sort of approach would help people see the red flags they perhaps overlooked/handwaved the first time through.

&gt;\&gt; Danerys I see as someone growing into a ruler who’s not evil and doesn’t see people as tools like most leader in GOT that want the throne.

Except Dany DOES see people as tools... just not as often as other leaders.

She literally went to Astapor specifically to purchase slaves... tools for her political gain.

She demands Hizdar marry her while he's wrongfully imprisoned... tool for her political gain.

She appropriates the Dothraki fighters to become sacrificable pawns in her personal upcoming battles (and basically wiped them out)... tools for her political gain.

She demands the Gold Road POWs to serve her or die... tools for her political gain.

She only agrees to an alliance with the North when she realizes that *she needs those people* in order to protect her goal of sitting the Iron Throne... tools.

She demands the North march south the moment she wants to help her win what she wants when she wants it... tools.

So let's not pretend like she's magically free of seeing people as tools. Want to argue she does it less, or is also able to see people as people? Sure, but she certainly sees/uses people as tools for her own personal gain, absolutely.

Just pointing out that she isn't perfect... she isn't some wholly benevolent figure... and she absolutely has this Fire and Blood persona alongside her Kind-Hearted side... *conflict within the human heart* and all that.","season 2"

My biggest example is that of Azhor Ahai. Azhor Ahai is never mentioned by name on the show ONCE and he is only vaguely referenced in passing one time in Season 2. I understand the book delves very heavily into this, but the show is an adaptation. The show is not beholden to anything in the books unless it actively sets it up. If it’s not referenced on the show, the expectation should be that it’s for a reason and because they’re going a different route. Same thing with the valonquar. The prophecy on the show is more bare bones. Yet all these theories were based on the books. I warned people not to expect pay off for those things since the show didn’t actively set them up and turns out I was right.","season 2"

"64","&gt;Exactly as she was supposed to be, as she was written.  It's amazing how many viewers never got past that, that they couldn't figure out her evolution as a character was a big part of the story.

Which is strange because, IIRC, even as early as Season 2 she's showing growth. She's showing some realization that she's been some naive girl, she shows a clear desire and appreciation for Winterfell, she starts learning politics a bit, and sees Joffrey/Cersei for who they are. 

And that grows into her literally doing everything she can for Winterfell in the latter seasons. 

&gt;\&gt; I've seen people say that they hate Sansa because she was mean to Dany, like kids at a playground or something. If any more evidence were needed that a lot of folks' views on GoT are driven by the pretty blonde queen not winning the game, there it is.

Absolutely. It's wild that some people claim Sansa is some evil bitch because she's defending her homeland from 'usurpers' while Dany's whole Westeros story is basically the same thing. And it does reinforce the notion that some viewers wholly supported Dany to the point where they see anyone who stands in her way as some evil opponent, no matter how 'just' or reasonable their actions may have been.","season 2"

"70","&gt;Daenerys suddenly going mad and killing people when her whole thing is empowerment and freedom of the people.

Except Dany's ""whole thing"" is not empowerment and freedom of the people.. that was just an arc she had for a few seasons... from the middle of Season 3 to the end of Season 5... that's it. Maybe 25 episodes out of 70+. 

Seasons 1, 2, the start of 3, 7 and 8 are all about her conquest for the Iron Throne... the majority of the show. 

Sure, Dany deserves mad props for her actions in Slaver's Bay, but people need to stop pretending like that was her entire character, as it completely undermines/downplays her very clearly established Fire and Blood persona and personal desire for this grand political power. 

It seems clear that people tend to overblow the aspects about characters they admire (like Dany and Jaime) and seemingly handwave/overlook their negative aspects, despite being rather plainly displayed on-screen for all to see. 

&gt;Jamie joining Cerci and the two die by rocks falling when there was a prophecy that said she would die by her brother's hand (and though she always thought it would be Tyrion, the Kingslayer was being built to become the Queen slayer).

The Valonquar prophecy is not show canon though, sorry. Would have been interesting to see, for sure, but it seemed pretty clear they weren't going to go that route considering they made the effort to edit that portion of the prophecy out of the show.","season 3"
"71","Dany and Jamie scenes.

Some viewers sure love to whinge about how those character arcs ended, but seemingly tend to forget/are unaware that their actions/choices in the end absolutely have had the groundwork laid for them across their entire arc leading up to Season 8.

Some people, over time, seemingly placed these two characters on some pedestal where only some grand animated Disney resolution would suffice, but, on-screen, these characters are portrayed as gray characters capable of both great and terrible acts, often based on both great and terrible choices.

Dany so often shows this Fire and Blood persona throughout her arc (as her advisors constantly tell her to tone it down) and her relationship with *power* becomes an increasingly suspect one, as when she doesn't have it she curses those who abuse it, but then as she gains power seemingly abuses it herself. Her whole arc is a series of hypocritical words/acts mixed with this fiery persona building up to a boiling point as her world comes crashing down upon her during her time in Westeros.

Also, people love to claim that her ""entire story"" revolved around helping the innocent, but that wasn't really the case, as it was a temporary goal of hers from midway in Season 3 (she literally went to Slaver's Bay in order to specifically purchase fighting slaves) to the end of Season 5 (when she rides off on Drogon.) That's it... aside from one single episode in Season 6, so maybe 25 episodes out of 70+. It's a nice arc, and certainly helps show off one side to her character (that many fans latched onto) but hardly an ""entire story"" as tends to get parroted. She spends Seasons 1, 2, half of 3, 7 and 8 trying to win the Iron Throne for herself... clearly a majority of her on-screen time.

As for Jaime, he so clearly has this soft spot for Cersei and literal life-long bond with her that I'm surprised so many people were gobsmacked by his decision. He literally spends 7+ seasons doing anything/everything for her while not giving two fucks about anyone not named Lannister (or Brienne), but people seemingly are surprised that he went back to her simply because he slept with someone else once over 40+ years? And are surprised that he stated that he didn't care about people, despite it being pretty obvious for 7+ seasons that he didn't care about people. I mean, there are specific scenes when he is with Cersei when he literally states that he doesn't care about anyone else, but somehow people think their own personal head canon/interpretation of the bath scene magically supercedes what he literally states on-screen about the commonfolk.

I honestly believe if you review these two characters with an open mind and fresh eyes, that Season 8 is not ""as bad"" as many people claim. Sure, the last seasons will always be a bit rough, but I think having a unbiased understanding of these two characters will help anyone understand how these two arcs end by shedding a neutral light on how these characters got to this point.","season 3"
"72","&gt;She sentenced the Tarley's because they brought down their liege Lord's house, which was loyal to Daenerys.  She gave them an out; bend the knee or take the Black.  Tarley declined both and  died for it.

Except this is mostly fiction. 

I realize people have parroted this nonsense so much that some people actually believe it, but Dany never offers them the Black. 

Tyrion merely mentions it as an idea... which obviously is not the same as Dany offering it. 

She starts her spiel with 'serve me or die', never agrees to anything Tyrion offers, then finished her spiel by executing them for refusing to serve. 

She clearly never wavers on her ""serve me or die"" stance, and she clearly never offers them the Black. 

Those are the facts, hence that is the show canon. 

&gt;\&gt; It only occurred to me now that in the midst of shitty writing aimed to have Daenerys go mad, her side never offered an ultimatum to Cersei. 

It would have been interesting to see that, sure, but not it's not really out of character for Dany to retaliate in a *Fire and Blood* manner, considering how she reacts to when she/her allies are attacked, like when Selmy was killed. Would have been interesting to see Tyrion try and offer her this option, and see that anger in her that we've seen time and time again seek blood instead of peace as she shoots him down and chooses to attack.  

&gt;\&gt; As for Essos, the ones she freed were allowed to leave or follow her. She did this because her primary want was to free slaves. The Unsullied, she needed, but let make the choice anyway.

OK, so can we agree that her primary goal in Westeros, based on her actions here, was *not* to help the oppressed then? Based on her actions here compared to those back in Astapor, clearly she is not concerned with these people like she was with the Unsullied... is that fair to say?  

All of these POWs were forced to fight against their will, else be accused of Treason/executed, not unlike the Unsullied were... so if she is the ""same"" as she was in Season 3, shouldn't she offer them a similar choice? 

Does she not know that these people are being forced to fight? Sure, these POWs aren't slaves per se, but this situation is not wholly different from that in Astapor, **as these people are being ordered to fight for someone else under threat of death.** 

Aren't these literally the people she promised to help? Is she not aware that these people... *her subjects.*.. aren't really her enemies? 

She makes the very clear choice to subjugate them in some tyrannical act by forcing them to serve her or be killed. 

Would have been interesting had she actually offered them the Black, but that is not show canon... merely some biased fabrication formed in the echo chamber that is this subreddit.","season 3"
"73","It's simple... because she is the most hypocritical character portrayed within the show.

Just look at the examples:

When a captive of the Dothraki kills a Khal, she sees them as wrong and executes them for their actions... but later she herself, when captured by the Dothraki decides to kill the Khals.

She executes Mossador for taking matters into his own hands for killing a slaver outside of ""court"", but later after Selmy is killed has zero problems just executing a slaver outside of ""court"", regardless of innocence/guilt even.

Complains about being forced to marry for political gain... then forces a wrongfully imprisoned prisoner to marry her for her own political gain when it suits her agenda.

Is upset in Astapor that people are inhumanely executing for refusing to serve... later executes people who refuse to serve her in Westeros.

When she believes she has the rightful claim to the throne it is all important and she expects everyone to literally bow before her and hand her ships just because of her title... when it is discovered Jon is the rightful heir suddenly the ""rightful heir"" tag is completely meaningless in regards to who should sit on the Iron Throne and she still wants the throne for herself anyways.

Claims rulers in Westeros are corrupt/evil for what they do, then she does the exact same nonsense when she's in power... threatening Jon in regards to bending the knee , executing Tarleys for refusing to kneel, subjugating POWs through fear, etc.

I do think there's a very clear shift in her from Seasons 3 to Season 7. As you stated, in Season 3 she has people follow her because they believe in her message because her message is a just one, but in Season 7 she uses fear and power to subjugate people to follow her, like the Crown POWs and Jon

Season 3: allows the people she's freed to choose their own path.

Season 7: subjugates her subjects through fear and threat of execution.

It's a shift in her character that a lot of viewers seemingly overlooked/hand-waved away, but at the end of the day it seems fairly clear that she's just a hypocrite who hates the system when looking at it at a distance from the outside, but has zero problems abusing it to her personal gain when it benefits her.

Basically she claims she's all about free choice, but then burns anyone who doesn't agree with her.","season 3"
"74","&gt;These are not the actions of someone who does not care about people except for Cersei.

But they are. 

You act like his actions are on par with Dany Seasons 3-6... which is absolutely absurd, because they absolutely are not. 

From Seasons 1-7.999, outside of his growing bond with Brienne, everything he does is either for himself, for Cersei, or to grow Lannister power. Perpetrating war. Killing/threatening innocents multiple times. Siding with Cersei after he knows she blew up the Sept, etc. He shows less than zero interest in the commonfolk. For 7 seasons. 

Literally says as much on-screen multiple times... that 'he only cares about himself and Cersei' or he would massacre everyone in Riverrun just to get back to Cersei, ethc. 

Even going North is about him and his honor... not that he actually believes an over-the-hill one-handed fighter is magically going to save the people. 

&gt;\&gt; Even that is a punch in the face because he at least had the honor to be faithful to Cersie and not lay with any other women. I understand there are a lot of vows but he seems to be very selective in which vows are more important than others.

OK. He stated his stance on vows when speaking with Catelyn, so feel like we knew this way back in Season 3. 

&gt;\&gt; Undo might be a bit of a strong word, fuck up might be more accurate because now when you watch those scenes in the context of the entire series it just makes me feel like the writers, not the character, are lying to you.

Except it's not a 'fuck-up'... it's an intentional choice by the original writer... wild that some people still can't understand this.  

Sorry that you feel that way, but that's something you're going to have to deal with yourself, as there's nothing inherently wrong with having a character ""fall off the wagon."" It's a realistic character choice for this character, who so obviously has this bond with Cersei, to make. There's nothing *wrong* with it. 

Don't like it? That's the point... but doesn't inherently make it ""bad"" or ""wrong"" or ""character assassination"" like some viewers try and claim. 

Most every character got a relatively happy ending... it's unfair to focus on the ones who did not and whinge ad naseum because you didn't like it.","season 3"

"78","First off, might want to dispel the notion that her entire identity was about freeing slaves and realize that literally most of her screentime was spent pursuing power for herself. 

Seasons 1, 2, and the beginning of 3? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. Seasons 7 and 8? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. So 4.5 seasons of conquering versus less than 3 about freeing slaves (back half of Season 3, Season 4, Season 5, one episode in Season 6.. the clear minority.)

Her time in Slaver's Bay was a single arc, not some 'whole' identity. 

That said, I think a fresh and unbiased rewatch always helps paint a clearer picture of the issue. 

Season 8 completely implodes her world around her. If you see her psyche as a Jenga tower, it's easy to see how it becomes increasingly unstable throughout the final season until it is this unstable, teetering structure that finally topples over in an emotional moment. 

Her support structure crumbles (deaths, betrayals), her hopes and dreams and beliefs shattered (Jon's heritage reveal, she's not the Chosen One, Westeros doesn't love her) and her promising relationships all sour (killed, betrayed, Jon's romantic relationship ends.)

Keep in mind she's a young adult with a fucked-up upbringing (sold, raped, etc) with a Fire and Blood persona and family history of mental issues. Her entire world comes crashing down on her in a short amount of time, and this is a person who, has literally stated from her own mouth multiple times previously that she is capable/willing to raze entire cities if she feels the ends justify the means. 

She clearly states, in the latter episodes an increasingly deteriorated mental state, that she now sees the people of King's Landing as 'supporting' Cersei (ie, enemies) and that she has decided to ""Rule by Fear.""

Then, once she sees the Red Keep, that Jenga tower that's been teetering on a single piece because of all the other pieces that once held it in place are missing, finally topples over, and that Fire and Blood persona that's been bubbling up all this time is finally unleashed in full force. 

Wish we could have gleaned more context from the scene if we could have seen her as she razed part of King's Landing, but unfortunately we didn't get to see her again until the aftermath in the next episode.","season 3"

But GoT is more like one long story. If you stop at season 4 you'll be like what the heck is the point of Brans story, who is going to end up king, what kind of man is Jamie going to end up being etc etc. 

Since the whole series is building up and so dependent on the finals seasons, the final seasons ends up dragging down the earlier seasons moreso.","season 4"

Batman is just good example, everything he does is praised badass even though most of it is basic plot twists.","season 4"
"94","Yes they are still worth watching. 

I read all the books before starting to watch them right before season 4 came out and I was a dedicated fan after that. Went to the concert (front row!) and everything. 
I am rewatching the entire series now with my boyfriend and we are currently in season 7. The one thing I didn't pick up on before-- and that had annoyed me when I first watched-- was that the subtle hints of foreshadowing in the dialogue had fallen away. In season 7 it's not so much foreshadowing as it is callbacks to season 1, which is making it more enjoyable this time around.

Her support structure crumbles (deaths, betrayals), her hopes and dreams and beliefs shattered (Jon's heritage reveal, she's not the Chosen One, Westeros doesn't love her) and her promising relationships all sour (killed, betrayed, Jon's romantic relationship ends.)

Keep in mind she's a young adult with a fucked-up upbringing (sold, raped, etc) with a Fire and Blood persona and family history of mental issues. Her entire world comes crashing down on her in a short amount of time, and this is a person who, has literally stated from her own mouth multiple times previously that she is capable/willing to raze entire cities if she feels the ends justify the means. 

She clearly states, in the latter episodes an increasingly deteriorated mental state, that she now sees the people of King's Landing as 'supporting' Cersei (ie, enemies) and that she has decided to ""Rule by Fear.""

Then, once she sees the Red Keep, that Jenga tower that's been teetering on a single piece because of all the other pieces that once held it in place are missing, finally topples over, and that Fire and Blood persona that's been bubbling up all this time is finally unleashed in full force. 

Wish we could have gleaned more context from the scene if we could have seen her as she razed part of King's Landing, but unfortunately we didn't get to see her again until the aftermath in the next episode.","season 4"

"100","It comes down to George and D&amp;D (Dan and Dave) having creative differences. They (D&amp;D) were confident that they could do it in 7.5 seasons, but George wanted 10-13 seasons and had already started to divorce himself from the show around Season 4-5 because of this so he could focus on finishing the books and developing the spinoff source material. He finished writing Fire and Blood, the source material for HotD, in this time. 

George gave Dan and Dave bullet points of how the story would end, which is why they essentially gave you the items from his list, and they utterly lack the ability to get from point A to point C by gracefully going from A to B to C letter to letter, instead they thought they could kind of forget B and slap dash it together from A right to C.","season 4"

"109","I hear you, and I’m sure the upboats make you feel vindicated but I will try to put it simply. 

Nothing is perfect. The first few seasons had their issues. They were still historic in the quality and depth of characters and storytelling. 

Where the first few seasons issues were minor, the final season’s issues were glaring. Instead of beating a dead horse with all the details I will once again refer you to the limitless amount of information already available on this topic.

I mean, there’s a reason GRRM started expressing serious concerns by Season 5, and by season 7 he was flying out to meet the HBO boss *monthly*.  Just to beg him to right the veering ship. 

If you genuinely think this is a case of all of us, including the ingenious mind of GRRM that created the damn universe in the first place, having inherent bias for the first seasons while putting the final season under unnecessary scrutiny… Well, we simply have fundamental disagreements of what makes exceptional television. 

Because the first 4 seasons, despite their flaws, were *exceptional.* I **do not** feel under any circumstances the final season can be seen as exceptional, unless one simply does not have a discerning bone in their body when it comes to what makes exceptional television. Honestly, some people are just enjoying the ride and don’t need to play critic. That’s cool. 

But it is the opinion of myself and millions of other fans, critics, etc that the final season was lackluster at best, and a downright travesty at worst.","season 5"

"111","Core books of A Song of Ice and Fire series:

1. _A Game of Thrones_ corresponds to Season 1
2. _A Clash of Kings_ corresponds to Season 2
3. _A Storm of Swords_ corresponds to Seasons 3-4
4. _A Feast for Crows_ some plotlines used from Season 5+
5. _A Dance with Dragons_ ditto
6. _The Winds of Winter_, unfinished, material from some sample chapters used in Season 6
7. _A Dream of Spring_, title of what's supposed to be the final novel, someday

Prequel novellas in “Dunk &amp; Egg” timeline, about a century before ASOIAF, collected in _A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms_. These were originally published as non-spoilery jumping-on points for new readers between the early novels, and you can read them whenever you like. Some D&amp;E elements are referenced in the later novels as Easter eggs (and may also be clues towards/set up important historical stuff), especially in AFFC onwards:

1. “The Hedge Knight”, originally in _Legends_ anthology edited by Robert Silverberg, reprinted with some commentary by GRRM in his _Dreamsongs: A RRetrospective_ short story collection
2. “The Sworn Sword”, originally in _Legends II_ anthology
3. “The Mystery Knight”, originally in _Warriors_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois

Prequel fake history books, written in the style of a maester recounting and commenting upon past events:

1. _Fire &amp; Blood_, covering approximately half the time since the Targaryen Conquest 300 years before ASOIAF. Parts of this have previously appearead as the following novellas which were originally published in anthologies (mostly minor changes, “The Princess and the Queen” is the most expanded). NB: this starts straight at the Conquest and doesn't cover the situation leading up to it, which you'd have to get from TWOIAF if you're interested:

	a. “Sons of the Dragon” with Aegon the Conqueror's heirs, originally in _The Book of Swords_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois  
	b. “The Princess and the Queen”, rivalry of Rhaenyra and Alicent which will be part of House of the Dragon show, originally in _Dangerous Women_ anthology  
	c. “The Rogue Prince”, some events of TPATQ focusing on Daemon Targaryen, originally in _Rogues_ anthology

Prequel fake history books that are tie-in supplements:

1. _The World of Ice and Fire_, heavily illustrated lorebook/artbook, with the first half giving a history from the earliest prehistorical times, then the Conquest and the reigns of all the Targaryen rulers up until just before Robert's Rebellion more than a decade before the start of ASOIAF. The back half gives regional histories for all Seven Kingdoms, plus the lands of Essos and beyond. Only parts of it are written by GRRM (as sidebars from “Maester Gyldayn”), the rest written up by his co-authors from his notes.  
  
  NB: there's a couple of spoilers for particular major events from AGOT through ASOS in the fake intro and the fake outro, so you may choose to skip reading those parts until you've finished those novels (and maybe also Dunk &amp; Egg since some of the history chapters give away the fates of certain guest characters), but otherwise pretty much everything else in it won't involve details of the main series storylines.
2. upcoming _The Rise of the Dragon_, again mostly done by GRRM's co-authors, basically a rewrite of parts of F&amp;B into a more encyclopedic style like TWOIAF, lavishly illustrated with new art

Other supplementary books:

- _The Lands of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in book of foldout maps showing all the regions in more detail and full colour, nice to have, but note necessary
- _A Feast of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in cookbook with recipes based on the series, foreword by GRRM
- _The Wit and Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister_, just quotes from the books, with a few cartoony illustrations, IMHO not worth it unless you find it in a bargain discount bin and are morbidly curious
- “A World of Ice and Fire” official tie-in app for Android &amp; iOS devices, done by the TWOIAF co-authors. Wiki-style mini-encyclopedia of characters and places throughout the books with illustrations taken from other official tie-ins, with a slider that can be set per-book (paid content) to avoid spoilers. Apparently has some trivia tidbits not found in TWOIAF and the official fansite's wiki, taken from GRRM's notes. The free section has the entirety of the entries for the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas, as well as several but not all of the TWOW sample chapters released so far (easiest way to read most of them, IMHO), and a few more sample chapters from TWOIAF, and sample maps from TLOAIF.

Not a tie-in, even though the back copy advertises it as such:

- “The Ice Dragon”, a novella set in an entirely different fantasy universe, but some of whose ideas were speculated to have been used in Season 7 and might be relevant to future novels, available reprinted in _Dreamsongs_ and in a standalone illustrated hardcover/ebook edition.
- you may also come across mention of “Blood of the Dragon”, “Path of the Dragon”, and “The Arms of the Kraken”. These are just novellas compiled from selected POV chapters from the ASOIAF novels, repackaged into a storyline following just the one character as a promo.

Bonus editions with extras:

AGOT through ASOS are currently available in rather nice The Illustrated Edition anniversary hardcovers with artwork depicting characters and events (there are also other licensed illustrated editions from specialty publishers with different art, but these are the more common and affordable ones from Penguin Random House &amp; HarperCollins Voyager).

And the entire series so far is also available in a very nice The Enhanced Edition for Mac/iOS devices from the Apple iTunes Store, which has handy features showing a map of where each character is at the start of their chapter (taken from _The Lands of Ice and Fire_ mapbook), a recap of what happened in the last, a character glossary recapping what happened to them in previous books, some artwork and sample passages read from the audiobooks, and some footnotes giving worldbuilding background details and trivia tidbits (mostly pulled from interview quotes and GRRM's notes given to his helpers).

All the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas are available in a graphic novel adaptation if you like comics, and so are AGOT and ACOK in collected editions (ASOS is apparently also being done, but currently unfinished).

Hope this helps!","season 5"

I loved s6 even though many didnt, s7 was alright until the end and then s8. So many things wrong, and the YEARS of buildup and waiting for winter and then the night king immediately dies and...thats it. Sure you can say s8 is decent in terms of tv in general, but compared to the first half of the show it just doesnt even hit the same dimension. The worst part is the blatant character assassinations, and the Dany one isnt even as bad as others. Jon snow does absolutely nothing and his heritage doesnt matter at all, tyrion makes horrible decisions, Varys' death was so anticlimactic, Jamies arc was totally ruined, the night king was a joke, etc. I can go on and on, and honestly since the s8 finale I had no desire to ever watch it again, and I was a massive fan.

"113","&gt;Daenerys suddenly going mad and killing people when her whole thing is empowerment and freedom of the people.

Except Dany's ""whole thing"" is not empowerment and freedom of the people.. that was just an arc she had for a few seasons... from the middle of Season 3 to the end of Season 5... that's it. Maybe 25 episodes out of 70+. 

Seasons 1, 2, the start of 3, 7 and 8 are all about her conquest for the Iron Throne... the majority of the show. 

Sure, Dany deserves mad props for her actions in Slaver's Bay, but people need to stop pretending like that was her entire character, as it completely undermines/downplays her very clearly established Fire and Blood persona and personal desire for this grand political power. 

It seems clear that people tend to overblow the aspects about characters they admire (like Dany and Jaime) and seemingly handwave/overlook their negative aspects, despite being rather plainly displayed on-screen for all to see. 

&gt;Jamie joining Cerci and the two die by rocks falling when there was a prophecy that said she would die by her brother's hand (and though she always thought it would be Tyrion, the Kingslayer was being built to become the Queen slayer).

The Valonquar prophecy is not show canon though, sorry. Would have been interesting to see, for sure, but it seemed pretty clear they weren't going to go that route considering they made the effort to edit that portion of the prophecy out of the show.","season 5"

"117","Dany and Jamie scenes.

Some viewers sure love to whinge about how those character arcs ended, but seemingly tend to forget/are unaware that their actions/choices in the end absolutely have had the groundwork laid for them across their entire arc leading up to Season 8.

Some people, over time, seemingly placed these two characters on some pedestal where only some grand animated Disney resolution would suffice, but, on-screen, these characters are portrayed as gray characters capable of both great and terrible acts, often based on both great and terrible choices.

Dany so often shows this Fire and Blood persona throughout her arc (as her advisors constantly tell her to tone it down) and her relationship with *power* becomes an increasingly suspect one, as when she doesn't have it she curses those who abuse it, but then as she gains power seemingly abuses it herself. Her whole arc is a series of hypocritical words/acts mixed with this fiery persona building up to a boiling point as her world comes crashing down upon her during her time in Westeros.

Also, people love to claim that her ""entire story"" revolved around helping the innocent, but that wasn't really the case, as it was a temporary goal of hers from midway in Season 3 (she literally went to Slaver's Bay in order to specifically purchase fighting slaves) to the end of Season 5 (when she rides off on Drogon.) That's it... aside from one single episode in Season 6, so maybe 25 episodes out of 70+. It's a nice arc, and certainly helps show off one side to her character (that many fans latched onto) but hardly an ""entire story"" as tends to get parroted. She spends Seasons 1, 2, half of 3, 7 and 8 trying to win the Iron Throne for herself... clearly a majority of her on-screen time.

As for Jaime, he so clearly has this soft spot for Cersei and literal life-long bond with her that I'm surprised so many people were gobsmacked by his decision. He literally spends 7+ seasons doing anything/everything for her while not giving two fucks about anyone not named Lannister (or Brienne), but people seemingly are surprised that he went back to her simply because he slept with someone else once over 40+ years? And are surprised that he stated that he didn't care about people, despite it being pretty obvious for 7+ seasons that he didn't care about people. I mean, there are specific scenes when he is with Cersei when he literally states that he doesn't care about anyone else, but somehow people think their own personal head canon/interpretation of the bath scene magically supercedes what he literally states on-screen about the commonfolk.

I honestly believe if you review these two characters with an open mind and fresh eyes, that Season 8 is not ""as bad"" as many people claim. Sure, the last seasons will always be a bit rough, but I think having a unbiased understanding of these two characters will help anyone understand how these two arcs end by shedding a neutral light on how these characters got to this point.","season 5"

Although there is nothing wrong with just being a good mother, post modern feminists actually think it's a weakness to just be a good wife and mother who will do anything for their family.

Imo the super easy solution would have been to have Doran give his fire and blood speech at the end of the season and reveal that he’s been in kahoots with Varys all along to join forces with Daenerys once she invades. Maybe even have a small storyline in season 7/8 about Dany choosing between Trystane and Jon if they wanted that. 

Clearly it’s not as good as book material, but it at least resembles the Dornish storyline and it’s insane to me that they decided to trash it entirely.","season 5"

"126","&gt;My point is that my quotes are just as viable as yours, and arguably more so since she actually acted on these, she did free the slaves, she chained up her dragons, and she only made the city-destroying threats for betrayal such as when the master broke a promise and attacked, or when Yunki and Astapor were retaken by them.

OK, so when a woman going to the cops claiming that a man has threatened to rape/murder her multiple times, you're saying the cops are correct in siding with the man because he hasn't actually done the act he's threatened yet? Because his actions are more viable than his threats simply because he hasn't acted on the threats yet? As long as he volunteers at a soup kitchen and works for a non-profit organization, his actions automatically outweigh any and all vicious threats?  

That's your stance here? That because the willingness/capacity for a terrible act hasn't yet been acted upon, therefore it doesn't hold weight? 

Seems rather dismissive and short-sighted of a stance to take, considering how often the cops hand-wave the threats for the very reasons you cite, and that women, almost inevitably, end up harmed or killed. 

You absolutely can not pretend that she has not shown a capacity/willingness for genocide, or downplay it because it hasn't happened *yet*. 

It's like watching a tea kettle under growing pressure/heat and claiming it will never boil because it hasn't boiled *yet*... that's a fallacy. 

&gt;\&gt; Here is the thing, I am not saying Danny would never kill someone...

Not sure if you honestly missed the point or this is a cheap attempt at moving the goalposts, but replace ""murder"" with ""genocide"" and that's the point... it's just that it's not like people in the real world have access to giant dragons where they can easily raze cities (as opposed to murder, which is 'easily available'.)

Dany clearly showed a capacity/willingness to raze thousands of people, innocents and all, from her own mouth, on-screen, multiple times.  

She clearly is capable of the very act you claim she is not, and no amount of saving slaves magically undoes that, sorry. 

*The good does not wash out the bad.* 

&gt;\&gt; At least then I can see the still water, then some bubbles forming at the bottom, every once in a while rising to the top until it does finally reach said boiling point and I can finally put the pasta in.

And plenty of viewers saw and pointed out those very bubbles you claim never existed. Problem is that you weren't looking into the pot to see those signs while other people were checking for those very bubbles because they were concerned by all the red flags across her storyline.

Heck, characters on-screen literally point out the bubbles. Tyrion and Varys clearly take time out of a busy final seasons to make literal comparisons to her father, or point out how eager she is to raze King's Landing, or isn't listening to reason... those bubbles *absolutely exist on-screen*... it's up to the viewer to take a look into the pot. 

I mean, it's like you're in the living room, then complaining you can't see the bubbles forming in the bottom of the pot, while others standing by the stove are pointing them out. I mean, plenty of people/writers/podcasts pointed out the case for Mad Queen Dany even before S8E5 aired... because they saw the bubbles. 

&gt;\&gt; Now I can agree, she has gone through a lot, I think they portrayed these tragic events poorly and it comes off more that she will kill everyone because Jon wouldn't fuck her rather than the grief of losing her dragon and Misandi...

I think she hoped her and Jon could rule together, but he clearly dismissed that theory and that seemed to be a final straw for her. Believe it has more to do with Jon being the rightful heir and her claim is not the ""rightful one"" and they aren not able to rule together more than ""Jon wouldn't fuck her.""

&gt;\&gt; but my argument would be why is Danny so much weaker than everyone else?

Weaker? Nonsense... it's about Fire and Blood and upbrinings. 

She so obviously has the *Blood of the Dragon* in her, and that so obviously affects that family, including who raised her (Viserys.)

She has a fucked up life, raised by Viserys, affected by this Fire and Blood. Sold as a child bride, raped, etc. 

Starks grown up with a stable life, in Winterfell, with awesome parents. 

It's not hard to see a huge difference in their upbrinings, which would obviously affect their mental issues. 

&gt;\&gt; Idk about that, with how much of a mess season 5-7 were, I feel like the dots you're saying are there to connect are just 6 points that make you draw a pointy mountain and the book tells you it's a castle.

Look, tons of people pointed out the very real possibility of Mad Queen Dany long before S8E5 aired, so clearly there are dots that form that image. 

If you didn't see, or refuse to see it, that's on you, but that's like claiming Waldo isn't in a spread of Where's Waldo simply because you didn't see it then, and refuse to see it now. 

&gt;\&gt; I will admit that those reasons were part of it, yet the key component that can hold up to scrutiny is his want to save the people. 

There's absolutely nothing to back this fabricated theory of your though... like at all. 

&gt;For example, he never had a great relationship with his father and it only got worse when he joined the KG.

And do you think Jaime had a 'great relationship' with the people of King's Landing?! 

Also, even if his relationship with his father wasn't perfect doesn't mean he wouldn't try to save him over the Mad King. 

&gt;\&gt; Protecting the smallfolk is what holds up best under scrutiny when you look to his actions even after the events before we see much development with him, stepping in to save Brienne from getting raped, jumping into a bear pit to save her, armoring her and arming her to go find and save Sansa.

Lol, except nothing you state actually support your baseless theory about **him caring about the commonfolk.**   


&gt;\&gt; *stepping in to save* ***Brienne*** *from getting raped, jumping into a bear pit to save* ***her****, armoring* ***her*** *and arming her to go find and save Sansa.*

OK, all of these things revolve around **a single person who is the epitome of honor** in his eyes... HONOR. 

He develops a soft spot for Brienne because of **his troubled relationship with honor.**

Him helping her is about honor... not some empathy for the common folk. 

She obviously is not ""common folk"" (she is literally a knight from a prominent family, like him), so I've no clue why you think his soft spot for another knight magically translates into his empathy towards commonfolk... it's completely nonsensical to equate the two. 

PS - Also pawning off his oath by throwing money at Brienne is not really as honorable as people want to pretend. If you promised to take your kids to the beach, you don't get credit for doing so by giving gas money to your neighbors (who were already planning on going) and having them take them instead so you can get your rocks off at home. 

Stopping her from getting raped and jumping into the bear pit... incredibly selfless and he deserves mad props for that, absolutely. But arming someone else so he doesn't have to deal with the Stark girls so he can remain a Lannister lap dog is just throwing money at something he didn't want to do, so he can remain by Cersei's side (or do her bidding.)","season 5"

&gt;Lol, just because a line is spoken doesn't magically make it some ironclad truth... wild that 8 seasons of Game of Thrones hasn't taught you that.  
&gt;  
&gt;I mean, you seemingly claim a character's word is ironclad and cherry-pick some quote as if it's gospel, but when I point out that she, multiple times STATED ON-SCREEN she going to kill thousands upon thousands of innocents because she wanted to, that doesn't count in your eyes? Only the quotes you cherry pick matter or count as canon or can be construed as fact? Any quotes that disprove your quotes magically don't count because Dany reasons?  
&gt;  
&gt;Talk about bad faith discussion.  


I got plenty of more, ""I am not my father."" ""I am not here to be queen of the Ashes."" ""Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city."" ""I don't want another child's bones dropped at my feet."" ""I am a queen, not a butcher.""   


And how am I cherry-picking? My point wasn't ""This is everything Danny has ever said this proves my point and your quote was fabricated."" That would be ridiculous.  


You brought up the scene where she threatens to burn all the wise masters cities while watching them attack her city and trying to burn it down. My point is that my quotes are just as viable as yours, and arguably more so since she actually acted on these, she did free the slaves, she chained up her dragons, and she only made the city-destroying threats for betrayal such as when the master broke a promise and attacked, or when Yunki and Astapor were retaken by them. The people of Kingslanding have not done anything of the sort and even still despite the masters being the worse and honestly even I would have defended her if she whipped them out she didn't likely not just for moral reasons but practicality as well as listening to Tyrion got her the ships she needed to sail to Westeros and abandon Mereen, which is an issue itself but I am trying to focus on season 8 and the shit stain that it is. 

&gt;I mean, if in one scene a character says they would never kill someone, then in multiple other scenes they clearly state they would kill someone, can you honestly defend the theory that they would never kill someone?  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course not.  


Here is the thing, I am not saying Danny would never kill someone, hell she smothered her own husband, she burned hundred of soldiers to death, no killing isn't my issue, good character like Jon have killed people, and it was much more hands on, but does that mean I can picture him ordering his men to sack and burn villages, cutting the throats of the smallfolk or turning them to ash on a Dragon? Hell no, and hey you know what, it would make more sense for Jon to do this than Danny because Jon actually has killed a kid with his own hands.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's not that complex... she's like a tea kettle. Over time the pressure builds and builds until that pressure literally reaches a boiling point. We know she has this Fire and Blood persona bubbling up underneath, Season 8 completely implodes her entire world, her psyche is shot and that Fire and Blood persona is no longer 'contained', and she reaches this emotional climax where that Fire and Blood persona hits a violent boiling point.  


You do know that by comparisons achieving boiling water takes longer then Danny falling into madness. At least then I can see the still water, then some bubbles forming at the bottom, every once in a while rising to the top until it does finally reach said boiling point and I can finally put the pasta in.   


Now I can agree, she has gone through a lot, I think they portrayed these tragic events poorly and it comes off more that she will kill everyone because Jon wouldn't fuck her rather than the grief of losing her dragon and Misandi, but my argument would be why is Danny so much weaker than everyone else?  


Jon, Sansa, and Arya have arguably gone through just as hard of times if not worse then Danny and are still somewhat mentally sound, the most fucked up being Arya but even she saw what Danny did and smartly said ""I no a killer when I see one."" WOW THANKS ARYA WE NEVER WOULD HAVE FIGURED THAT OUT!!! Shit getting of topic again.  


But if that doesn't work for you since they are different characters then lets just look at the shit that Danny when through season, her child turned into a stillborn and her husband a vegetable by a women who she tried to save, her kindness and trust resulting in losing two things very important to her. Dare I say that scene has far more justification for her to go mad but she keeps to her more kind-hearted nature and goes on her mission to free the slaves. 

&gt;Sure, I think the show would have benefitted from more episodes to help with some pacing issues, absolutely.. but there's enough 'dots' to connect to see the picture... even if the picture isn't as detailed as it probably could have been.  


Idk about that, with how much of a mess season 5-7 were, I feel like the dots you're saying are there to connect are just 6 points that make you draw a pointy mountain and the book tells you it's a castle. 

&gt;\&gt; for it saved many of the innocents in kingslanding, otherwise why do it?  
&gt;  
&gt;Wait... are you serious?  
&gt;  
&gt;How about to save his father? To save Lannister forces? To save himself? TO help the Lannisters gain power? Because he fucking hates Aerys and what he did to people both behind closed doors and in public?  
&gt;  
&gt;If you honestly believe the only benefit for him to kill the Mad King was solely to help the commoners, you desperately need to revisit the actual story, because  ALL THE REASONS make sense for why Jaime did what he did... not just the single one you've cherry-picked and pretend is some sole reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;I mean, he literally mentions 'father' first in the bath scene question he proposes to Brienne... clearly there is more than a single reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again, you're cherry-picking here and pretending like nothing else exists surrounding the issue... bad faith.  


I will admit that those reasons were part of it, yet the key component that can hold up to scrutiny is his want to save the people. For example, he never had a great relationship with his father and it only got worse when he joined the KG.  
Saving the Lannister forces would coincide with saving the people, after all if he dose not care about the small folk why would he care about his fathers soldiers? Not to mention he actually fights against them to defend the red keep which would likely be to defend what smallfolk were able to retreat into the castle. And of course he hated Aerys we don't often kill people we like, unless your Danny, or Jon, or Tyrion, oh shit Jamie killed his cousin (I got my issues with that scene as well) so maybe he didn't hate Aryes.   


And as far as saving himself there were plenty of moments he could have just gotten away without risking his life, even in a way so that his ""honor"" would be intact much like Baristan. Running away and coming back after saying he fought hard and barely survived the wildfire eruption.   
Protecting the smallfolk is what holds up best under scrutiny when you look to his actions even after the events before we see much development with him, stepping in to save Brienne from getting raped, jumping into a bear pit to save her, armoring her and arming her to go find and save Sansa.","season 5"

"131","Hord up, hord up. I guess you can thank grrm for the source material and the books of course, but the show is all about DD for all the good and bad. Actually season 6 is where the source material is no more; from what I’ve read, season 5 is the last season based on the events of the books. However season 6 is a stand alone miracle season. No spoilers, but it’s one of the best seasons, and just think about what you’ve seen so far for yet another season topping prior ones.","season 5"
"132","i know, which is why i love season 5","season 5"

"134","Except they choose to ignore two of the books he wrote and go basically an entirely different direction for season 5.","season 5"
"135","Seasons 3 &amp; 4 are still close to the books. Starting at season 5, the gap gets wider and wider and the last two seasons is completely free style. You can feel it in the narrative : it becomes less coherent with sometimes huge plot holes. The serie also becomes more action-oriented with big battlefields... That sometimes feels weird, because badly designed.

To sum up, half of the serie is close to the books, the other half is like filler manga. It's nice and all, but weird and incoherent compared to the beginning.","season 5"
"136","First off, might want to dispel the notion that her entire identity was about freeing slaves and realize that literally most of her screentime was spent pursuing power for herself. 

Seasons 1, 2, and the beginning of 3? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. Seasons 7 and 8? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. So 4.5 seasons of conquering versus less than 3 about freeing slaves (back half of Season 3, Season 4, Season 5, one episode in Season 6.. the clear minority.)

Her time in Slaver's Bay was a single arc, not some 'whole' identity. 

That said, I think a fresh and unbiased rewatch always helps paint a clearer picture of the issue. 

Season 8 completely implodes her world around her. If you see her psyche as a Jenga tower, it's easy to see how it becomes increasingly unstable throughout the final season until it is this unstable, teetering structure that finally topples over in an emotional moment. 

Her support structure crumbles (deaths, betrayals), her hopes and dreams and beliefs shattered (Jon's heritage reveal, she's not the Chosen One, Westeros doesn't love her) and her promising relationships all sour (killed, betrayed, Jon's romantic relationship ends.)

Keep in mind she's a young adult with a fucked-up upbringing (sold, raped, etc) with a Fire and Blood persona and family history of mental issues. Her entire world comes crashing down on her in a short amount of time, and this is a person who, has literally stated from her own mouth multiple times previously that she is capable/willing to raze entire cities if she feels the ends justify the means. 

She clearly states, in the latter episodes an increasingly deteriorated mental state, that she now sees the people of King's Landing as 'supporting' Cersei (ie, enemies) and that she has decided to ""Rule by Fear.""

Then, once she sees the Red Keep, that Jenga tower that's been teetering on a single piece because of all the other pieces that once held it in place are missing, finally topples over, and that Fire and Blood persona that's been bubbling up all this time is finally unleashed in full force. 

Wish we could have gleaned more context from the scene if we could have seen her as she razed part of King's Landing, but unfortunately we didn't get to see her again until the aftermath in the next episode.","season 5"
"137","In hindsight the ending of GoT isn't THAT bad. Disappointing? Underwhelming? Poorly-executed? Absolutely. But upon an analysis of the characters, their motives and their experiences most of the resolution of the series largely makes sense. It is in all likelihood the general resolution that GRRM had planned, and the backlash is probably another in a long list of reasons he will never finish the books.

There were hints at Dany's mad queen side throughout the series. But instead of a gradual decline, the show just kind of flips a switch, which is not satisfying at all. It's like as if in Breaking Bad Walter White goes from Pilot episode HS chemistry teacher to Season 5 prison massacre ruthlessness in the span of one or two episodes. Just showing a budding jealousy of Jon, a betrayal by Varys and the sudden deaths of two of her dragons over the span of a few episodes wasn't enough after, like you said, seasons of portraying a benevolent liberator.","season 5"

"141","I don't feel the same way, but I understand why you'd feel that way.

The main reason why I don't feel that way is that, tbh, in my opinion the show started going downhill in season 5 and kept slowly going downhill for season 6, 7 and 8. So by the time season 8 rolled around I was already pretty emotionally disconnected from it all and wasn't expecting anything good.

I prefer to see seasons 1-4 as the REAL show and the canon show and think of 5-8 as some fan fiction that never happened. That allows me to enjoy seasons 1-4 for what they are, I think. Because I consider that the full TV story.","season 5"
"142","Intro to Season 6, Episode 10, no contest. IMO, it is the best example of storytelling through cinema that I have ever seen. The music, the use of silence, ending with poor Tommen stepping out the window while Cersei smiles and sips her wine unaware that in saving herself she has sacrificed her last living child. There truly aren't enough words. Incredible.

Honorable mentions, Sansa's coronation (all hail the Queen in the North) and Jaime bathtub scene (a man can ACT).

BOOK SPOILERS AHEAD--

If we're talking books, it's Quentyn Martell freeing the dragons. The reader is led through the scene by Quentyn processing movements in the dark, catching glimpses of the dragons as he goes. The way the dragons are described is mesmerizing.  We see a lot of Drogon in the show so it is nice to get such in depth descriptions of Rhaegal and Viserion on the page.","season 6"
"143","Jon Snow beating up Ramsay Bolton inside of Winterfell near the end of the Battle of the Bastards.  It was the climax of the Stark children returning to glory.  It was at the part of the story where Jon was emerging as the story's protagonist.

"144","&gt;“A monster has taken our home and our brother, we have to get them back.” They weren’t seeking power.

Yes they were.

*JON SNOW: We can’t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men.*

&gt;John was saying that THEIR treason has already been punished, because they were dead and the issue was moot.

Which suggests Jon would have executed them if they hadn't died.

&gt;I don’t see how that proves Arya wrong?

Sansa you mean? She ostensibly\* thought that placating Robbet Glover would keep him on Jon's side. It didn't. Letting people get away with open disrespect is a bad idea when you're at the head of dictatorship.

\*I don't know what she was supposed to be thinking in the final version, but the outline for season 7 has Sansa going along with what Robbet Glover said because [she was trying to steal Jon's position](https://imgur.com/a/hdV4ByK).

&gt;Literally any other punishment, put in a dungeon,

Did you notice that no one was sentenced to prison during the show? The only times we saw the dungeons was when someone was being tortured, waiting for trial, or waiting for their execution. No one was sentenced to a prison term because that's not a thing in that world. You have to have a certain amount of excess to think keeping people alive in cages is prudent thing to do. Jon wasn't going commit to feeding a bunch of traitors through winter.

&gt;kept as a servant prisoner like Osha,

Kept as a slave you mean? Slavery is illegal in Westeros. Keeping warriors that refuse to kneel as slaves is also a good way to get yourself murdered.

&gt;Yes I know he refused it, that’s not the point, the point is Tyrion offered it because he knew execution was wrong.

Tyrion oversaw the execution of two slavers at the end of season 6. Not to mention the fact that he murdered his father and ex girlfriend.","season 6"
"145","Not giving any spoilers, but you start to hate him initially but on later seasons you'll start loving him after he ""redeems himself"" , and you'll definitely cry when he finally dies.

"149","Core books of A Song of Ice and Fire series:

1. _A Game of Thrones_ corresponds to Season 1
2. _A Clash of Kings_ corresponds to Season 2
3. _A Storm of Swords_ corresponds to Seasons 3-4
4. _A Feast for Crows_ some plotlines used from Season 5+
5. _A Dance with Dragons_ ditto
6. _The Winds of Winter_, unfinished, material from some sample chapters used in Season 6
7. _A Dream of Spring_, title of what's supposed to be the final novel, someday

Prequel novellas in “Dunk &amp; Egg” timeline, about a century before ASOIAF, collected in _A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms_. These were originally published as non-spoilery jumping-on points for new readers between the early novels, and you can read them whenever you like. Some D&amp;E elements are referenced in the later novels as Easter eggs (and may also be clues towards/set up important historical stuff), especially in AFFC onwards:

1. “The Hedge Knight”, originally in _Legends_ anthology edited by Robert Silverberg, reprinted with some commentary by GRRM in his _Dreamsongs: A RRetrospective_ short story collection
2. “The Sworn Sword”, originally in _Legends II_ anthology
3. “The Mystery Knight”, originally in _Warriors_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois

Prequel fake history books, written in the style of a maester recounting and commenting upon past events:

1. _Fire &amp; Blood_, covering approximately half the time since the Targaryen Conquest 300 years before ASOIAF. Parts of this have previously appearead as the following novellas which were originally published in anthologies (mostly minor changes, “The Princess and the Queen” is the most expanded). NB: this starts straight at the Conquest and doesn't cover the situation leading up to it, which you'd have to get from TWOIAF if you're interested:

	a. “Sons of the Dragon” with Aegon the Conqueror's heirs, originally in _The Book of Swords_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois  
	b. “The Princess and the Queen”, rivalry of Rhaenyra and Alicent which will be part of House of the Dragon show, originally in _Dangerous Women_ anthology  
	c. “The Rogue Prince”, some events of TPATQ focusing on Daemon Targaryen, originally in _Rogues_ anthology

Prequel fake history books that are tie-in supplements:

1. _The World of Ice and Fire_, heavily illustrated lorebook/artbook, with the first half giving a history from the earliest prehistorical times, then the Conquest and the reigns of all the Targaryen rulers up until just before Robert's Rebellion more than a decade before the start of ASOIAF. The back half gives regional histories for all Seven Kingdoms, plus the lands of Essos and beyond. Only parts of it are written by GRRM (as sidebars from “Maester Gyldayn”), the rest written up by his co-authors from his notes.  
  
  NB: there's a couple of spoilers for particular major events from AGOT through ASOS in the fake intro and the fake outro, so you may choose to skip reading those parts until you've finished those novels (and maybe also Dunk &amp; Egg since some of the history chapters give away the fates of certain guest characters), but otherwise pretty much everything else in it won't involve details of the main series storylines.
2. upcoming _The Rise of the Dragon_, again mostly done by GRRM's co-authors, basically a rewrite of parts of F&amp;B into a more encyclopedic style like TWOIAF, lavishly illustrated with new art

Other supplementary books:

- _The Lands of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in book of foldout maps showing all the regions in more detail and full colour, nice to have, but note necessary
- _A Feast of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in cookbook with recipes based on the series, foreword by GRRM
- _The Wit and Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister_, just quotes from the books, with a few cartoony illustrations, IMHO not worth it unless you find it in a bargain discount bin and are morbidly curious
- “A World of Ice and Fire” official tie-in app for Android &amp; iOS devices, done by the TWOIAF co-authors. Wiki-style mini-encyclopedia of characters and places throughout the books with illustrations taken from other official tie-ins, with a slider that can be set per-book (paid content) to avoid spoilers. Apparently has some trivia tidbits not found in TWOIAF and the official fansite's wiki, taken from GRRM's notes. The free section has the entirety of the entries for the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas, as well as several but not all of the TWOW sample chapters released so far (easiest way to read most of them, IMHO), and a few more sample chapters from TWOIAF, and sample maps from TLOAIF.

Not a tie-in, even though the back copy advertises it as such:

- “The Ice Dragon”, a novella set in an entirely different fantasy universe, but some of whose ideas were speculated to have been used in Season 7 and might be relevant to future novels, available reprinted in _Dreamsongs_ and in a standalone illustrated hardcover/ebook edition.
- you may also come across mention of “Blood of the Dragon”, “Path of the Dragon”, and “The Arms of the Kraken”. These are just novellas compiled from selected POV chapters from the ASOIAF novels, repackaged into a storyline following just the one character as a promo.

Bonus editions with extras:

AGOT through ASOS are currently available in rather nice The Illustrated Edition anniversary hardcovers with artwork depicting characters and events (there are also other licensed illustrated editions from specialty publishers with different art, but these are the more common and affordable ones from Penguin Random House &amp; HarperCollins Voyager).

And the entire series so far is also available in a very nice The Enhanced Edition for Mac/iOS devices from the Apple iTunes Store, which has handy features showing a map of where each character is at the start of their chapter (taken from _The Lands of Ice and Fire_ mapbook), a recap of what happened in the last, a character glossary recapping what happened to them in previous books, some artwork and sample passages read from the audiobooks, and some footnotes giving worldbuilding background details and trivia tidbits (mostly pulled from interview quotes and GRRM's notes given to his helpers).

All the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas are available in a graphic novel adaptation if you like comics, and so are AGOT and ACOK in collected editions (ASOS is apparently also being done, but currently unfinished).

Hope this helps!","season 6"

"154","Dany and Jamie scenes.

Some viewers sure love to whinge about how those character arcs ended, but seemingly tend to forget/are unaware that their actions/choices in the end absolutely have had the groundwork laid for them across their entire arc leading up to Season 8.

Some people, over time, seemingly placed these two characters on some pedestal where only some grand animated Disney resolution would suffice, but, on-screen, these characters are portrayed as gray characters capable of both great and terrible acts, often based on both great and terrible choices.

Dany so often shows this Fire and Blood persona throughout her arc (as her advisors constantly tell her to tone it down) and her relationship with *power* becomes an increasingly suspect one, as when she doesn't have it she curses those who abuse it, but then as she gains power seemingly abuses it herself. Her whole arc is a series of hypocritical words/acts mixed with this fiery persona building up to a boiling point as her world comes crashing down upon her during her time in Westeros.

Also, people love to claim that her ""entire story"" revolved around helping the innocent, but that wasn't really the case, as it was a temporary goal of hers from midway in Season 3 (she literally went to Slaver's Bay in order to specifically purchase fighting slaves) to the end of Season 5 (when she rides off on Drogon.) That's it... aside from one single episode in Season 6, so maybe 25 episodes out of 70+. It's a nice arc, and certainly helps show off one side to her character (that many fans latched onto) but hardly an ""entire story"" as tends to get parroted. She spends Seasons 1, 2, half of 3, 7 and 8 trying to win the Iron Throne for herself... clearly a majority of her on-screen time.

As for Jaime, he so clearly has this soft spot for Cersei and literal life-long bond with her that I'm surprised so many people were gobsmacked by his decision. He literally spends 7+ seasons doing anything/everything for her while not giving two fucks about anyone not named Lannister (or Brienne), but people seemingly are surprised that he went back to her simply because he slept with someone else once over 40+ years? And are surprised that he stated that he didn't care about people, despite it being pretty obvious for 7+ seasons that he didn't care about people. I mean, there are specific scenes when he is with Cersei when he literally states that he doesn't care about anyone else, but somehow people think their own personal head canon/interpretation of the bath scene magically supercedes what he literally states on-screen about the commonfolk.

I honestly believe if you review these two characters with an open mind and fresh eyes, that Season 8 is not ""as bad"" as many people claim. Sure, the last seasons will always be a bit rough, but I think having a unbiased understanding of these two characters will help anyone understand how these two arcs end by shedding a neutral light on how these characters got to this point.","season 6"
"155","I honestly think I liked the season 6 best, and I think it did have a bit of the book material still.

Season 6 was considered one of, if not the best season of television while Ep9-10 were considered the best two episodes of television history. That’s on them.

At the end of the day, they made this show what it is. The casting, the soundtracks, the sets, costumes, it’s all due to them and who they hired to work with. Yes, the universe was already imagined and the story was partly written, but they put this unfinished story created to be unadaptable on screen and it became one of the biggest, most popular and critically acclaimed TV show of all time.

"161","I feel you. I shifted my expectations after the show surpassed the book content. Around season 6 (which is a season I still love) I noticed it slowly start inching into the standard Hollywood action movie level of writing the more that D&amp;D, your typical Hollywood writers, got more creative control. More shortcuts in the story were being taken, plot conveniences started occurring more, survival capabilities started turning more into comic book movie level. For me, it was never to the extent that it ruined the seasons and the positives of those seasons always outweighed the negatives. And I personally feel the same with season 8. Even though the tonal shift was a bit jarring due to what the show was for the first 4 or 5 seasons. Even then, especially since the issues I listen above really took a toll on S7, going into season 8 stressing over every detail wasn’t necessary. That’s like going into a Marvel film and expecting Breaking Bad or The Wire level of writing. Not saying it’s right, and I’m not saying the season shouldn’t have been fleshed out way better, but just because it could’ve been way better doesn’t mean we still got a dumpster fire of a season like some seem to act like. And I think more people are noticing this as they rewatch the series.

For me, it’s more of a case of I’m not going to let a few unideal things ruin the show I spent years of my life enjoying, especially when in my eyes, there was a lot in those seasons I could enjoy. And it was more than just the spectacle. I liked where all the character arcs ended up even if getting there was a tad clumsy.","season 6"

The Taryls owed their oath of fealty to the Tyrells. Not ""the crown"". That's why they backed the Tyrells in rebelling against Joffrey and Stannis.

&gt;Their Queen is Cersei -

How exactly did Cercei become their queen? She wasn't in the Baratheon line of succession. Her sitting on the throne doens't mean she automatically becomes everyone's queen.

&gt;so who is Daenerys to pass judgement and be jury and executioner to the Tarlys at that point?

The queen of the people they had just gotten through stealing from and murdering.

No. Randyll's peers sent ships to bring Dany's army over to Westeros at the end of season 6. I don't know how people forgot that.","season 6"

Actually season 6 is where the source material is no more; from what I’ve read, season 5 is the last season based on the events of the books. However season 6 is a stand alone miracle season. No spoilers, but it’s one of the best seasons, and just think about what you’ve seen so far for yet another season topping prior ones.","season 6"
"177","Battle of the Bastards from season 6 is the greatest battle scene ever put to film, for me (closely followed by the Battle of Stirling in Braveheart and the opening battle in Gladiator). It’s my favourite episode of tv ever! And this is why GoT is so frustrating - it has some of the greatest moments in tv history and yet also has some of the most disappointing moments too. It’s worth watching for those incredible moments but it’s so hard to recommend to anyone now because you know the final payoff is so unworthy of what came before and they will ultimately be left feeling disappointed.","season 6"

Like don’t get me wrong, Season 6 is an incredible season of television, but it’s no better written than Seasons 7 and 8. All I can hear off of threads like this is that you like it better since stuff went well for the characters you like in a way you don’t really have to think about (and, to be clear, I’m aware how pretentious that makes me sound). Daenerys sailing west with a massive armada is great - Daenerys immediately fucking that up and never recovering is way better and much truer to her character","season 6"

"185","First off, might want to dispel the notion that her entire identity was about freeing slaves and realize that literally most of her screentime was spent pursuing power for herself. 

Seasons 1, 2, and the beginning of 3? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. Seasons 7 and 8? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. So 4.5 seasons of conquering versus less than 3 about freeing slaves (back half of Season 3, Season 4, Season 5, one episode in Season 6.. the clear minority.)

Her time in Slaver's Bay was a single arc, not some 'whole' identity. 

That said, I think a fresh and unbiased rewatch always helps paint a clearer picture of the issue. 

Season 8 completely implodes her world around her. If you see her psyche as a Jenga tower, it's easy to see how it becomes increasingly unstable throughout the final season until it is this unstable, teetering structure that finally topples over in an emotional moment. 

Her support structure crumbles (deaths, betrayals), her hopes and dreams and beliefs shattered (Jon's heritage reveal, she's not the Chosen One, Westeros doesn't love her) and her promising relationships all sour (killed, betrayed, Jon's romantic relationship ends.)

Keep in mind she's a young adult with a fucked-up upbringing (sold, raped, etc) with a Fire and Blood persona and family history of mental issues. Her entire world comes crashing down on her in a short amount of time, and this is a person who, has literally stated from her own mouth multiple times previously that she is capable/willing to raze entire cities if she feels the ends justify the means. 

She clearly states, in the latter episodes an increasingly deteriorated mental state, that she now sees the people of King's Landing as 'supporting' Cersei (ie, enemies) and that she has decided to ""Rule by Fear.""

Then, once she sees the Red Keep, that Jenga tower that's been teetering on a single piece because of all the other pieces that once held it in place are missing, finally topples over, and that Fire and Blood persona that's been bubbling up all this time is finally unleashed in full force. 

Wish we could have gleaned more context from the scene if we could have seen her as she razed part of King's Landing, but unfortunately we didn't get to see her again until the aftermath in the next episode.","season 6"

"190","I don't feel the same way, but I understand why you'd feel that way.

The main reason why I don't feel that way is that, tbh, in my opinion the show started going downhill in season 5 and kept slowly going downhill for season 6, 7 and 8. So by the time season 8 rolled around I was already pretty emotionally disconnected from it all and wasn't expecting anything good.

I prefer to see seasons 1-4 as the REAL show and the canon show and think of 5-8 as some fan fiction that never happened. That allows me to enjoy seasons 1-4 for what they are, I think. Because I consider that the full TV story.","season 6"
"191","&gt;“A monster has taken our home and our brother, we have to get them back.” They weren’t seeking power.

Yes they were.

*JON SNOW: We can’t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men.*

&gt;John was saying that THEIR treason has already been punished, because they were dead and the issue was moot.

Which suggests Jon would have executed them if they hadn't died.

&gt;I don’t see how that proves Arya wrong?

Sansa you mean? She ostensibly\* thought that placating Robbet Glover would keep him on Jon's side. It didn't. Letting people get away with open disrespect is a bad idea when you're at the head of dictatorship.

\*I don't know what she was supposed to be thinking in the final version, but the outline for season 7 has Sansa going along with what Robbet Glover said because [she was trying to steal Jon's position](https://imgur.com/a/hdV4ByK).

&gt;Literally any other punishment, put in a dungeon,

Did you notice that no one was sentenced to prison during the show? The only times we saw the dungeons was when someone was being tortured, waiting for trial, or waiting for their execution. No one was sentenced to a prison term because that's not a thing in that world. You have to have a certain amount of excess to think keeping people alive in cages is prudent thing to do. Jon wasn't going commit to feeding a bunch of traitors through winter.

&gt;kept as a servant prisoner like Osha,

Kept as a slave you mean? Slavery is illegal in Westeros. Keeping warriors that refuse to kneel as slaves is also a good way to get yourself murdered.

&gt;Yes I know he refused it, that’s not the point, the point is Tyrion offered it because he knew execution was wrong.

Tyrion oversaw the execution of two slavers at the end of season 6. Not to mention the fact that he murdered his father and ex girlfriend.","season 7"

The whole episode on the frozen lake in season 7...
It's a show, they can make mistakes or stupid things for a good shot, to create tension / a cliffhanger.

"198","I hear you, and I’m sure the upboats make you feel vindicated but I will try to put it simply. 

Nothing is perfect. The first few seasons had their issues. They were still historic in the quality and depth of characters and storytelling. 

Where the first few seasons issues were minor, the final season’s issues were glaring. Instead of beating a dead horse with all the details I will once again refer you to the limitless amount of information already available on this topic.

I mean, there’s a reason GRRM started expressing serious concerns by Season 5, and by season 7 he was flying out to meet the HBO boss *monthly*.  Just to beg him to right the veering ship. 

If you genuinely think this is a case of all of us, including the ingenious mind of GRRM that created the damn universe in the first place, having inherent bias for the first seasons while putting the final season under unnecessary scrutiny… Well, we simply have fundamental disagreements of what makes exceptional television. 

Because the first 4 seasons, despite their flaws, were *exceptional.* I **do not** feel under any circumstances the final season can be seen as exceptional, unless one simply does not have a discerning bone in their body when it comes to what makes exceptional television. Honestly, some people are just enjoying the ride and don’t need to play critic. That’s cool. 

But it is the opinion of myself and millions of other fans, critics, etc that the final season was lackluster at best, and a downright travesty at worst.","season 7"

"200","Core books of A Song of Ice and Fire series:

1. _A Game of Thrones_ corresponds to Season 1
2. _A Clash of Kings_ corresponds to Season 2
3. _A Storm of Swords_ corresponds to Seasons 3-4
4. _A Feast for Crows_ some plotlines used from Season 5+
5. _A Dance with Dragons_ ditto
6. _The Winds of Winter_, unfinished, material from some sample chapters used in Season 6
7. _A Dream of Spring_, title of what's supposed to be the final novel, someday

Prequel novellas in “Dunk &amp; Egg” timeline, about a century before ASOIAF, collected in _A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms_. These were originally published as non-spoilery jumping-on points for new readers between the early novels, and you can read them whenever you like. Some D&amp;E elements are referenced in the later novels as Easter eggs (and may also be clues towards/set up important historical stuff), especially in AFFC onwards:

1. “The Hedge Knight”, originally in _Legends_ anthology edited by Robert Silverberg, reprinted with some commentary by GRRM in his _Dreamsongs: A RRetrospective_ short story collection
2. “The Sworn Sword”, originally in _Legends II_ anthology
3. “The Mystery Knight”, originally in _Warriors_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois

Prequel fake history books, written in the style of a maester recounting and commenting upon past events:

1. _Fire &amp; Blood_, covering approximately half the time since the Targaryen Conquest 300 years before ASOIAF. Parts of this have previously appearead as the following novellas which were originally published in anthologies (mostly minor changes, “The Princess and the Queen” is the most expanded). NB: this starts straight at the Conquest and doesn't cover the situation leading up to it, which you'd have to get from TWOIAF if you're interested:

	a. “Sons of the Dragon” with Aegon the Conqueror's heirs, originally in _The Book of Swords_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois  
	b. “The Princess and the Queen”, rivalry of Rhaenyra and Alicent which will be part of House of the Dragon show, originally in _Dangerous Women_ anthology  
	c. “The Rogue Prince”, some events of TPATQ focusing on Daemon Targaryen, originally in _Rogues_ anthology

Prequel fake history books that are tie-in supplements:

1. _The World of Ice and Fire_, heavily illustrated lorebook/artbook, with the first half giving a history from the earliest prehistorical times, then the Conquest and the reigns of all the Targaryen rulers up until just before Robert's Rebellion more than a decade before the start of ASOIAF. The back half gives regional histories for all Seven Kingdoms, plus the lands of Essos and beyond. Only parts of it are written by GRRM (as sidebars from “Maester Gyldayn”), the rest written up by his co-authors from his notes.  
  
  NB: there's a couple of spoilers for particular major events from AGOT through ASOS in the fake intro and the fake outro, so you may choose to skip reading those parts until you've finished those novels (and maybe also Dunk &amp; Egg since some of the history chapters give away the fates of certain guest characters), but otherwise pretty much everything else in it won't involve details of the main series storylines.
2. upcoming _The Rise of the Dragon_, again mostly done by GRRM's co-authors, basically a rewrite of parts of F&amp;B into a more encyclopedic style like TWOIAF, lavishly illustrated with new art

Other supplementary books:

- _The Lands of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in book of foldout maps showing all the regions in more detail and full colour, nice to have, but note necessary
- _A Feast of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in cookbook with recipes based on the series, foreword by GRRM
- _The Wit and Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister_, just quotes from the books, with a few cartoony illustrations, IMHO not worth it unless you find it in a bargain discount bin and are morbidly curious
- “A World of Ice and Fire” official tie-in app for Android &amp; iOS devices, done by the TWOIAF co-authors. Wiki-style mini-encyclopedia of characters and places throughout the books with illustrations taken from other official tie-ins, with a slider that can be set per-book (paid content) to avoid spoilers. Apparently has some trivia tidbits not found in TWOIAF and the official fansite's wiki, taken from GRRM's notes. The free section has the entirety of the entries for the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas, as well as several but not all of the TWOW sample chapters released so far (easiest way to read most of them, IMHO), and a few more sample chapters from TWOIAF, and sample maps from TLOAIF.

Not a tie-in, even though the back copy advertises it as such:

- “The Ice Dragon”, a novella set in an entirely different fantasy universe, but some of whose ideas were speculated to have been used in Season 7 and might be relevant to future novels, available reprinted in _Dreamsongs_ and in a standalone illustrated hardcover/ebook edition.
- you may also come across mention of “Blood of the Dragon”, “Path of the Dragon”, and “The Arms of the Kraken”. These are just novellas compiled from selected POV chapters from the ASOIAF novels, repackaged into a storyline following just the one character as a promo.

Bonus editions with extras:

AGOT through ASOS are currently available in rather nice The Illustrated Edition anniversary hardcovers with artwork depicting characters and events (there are also other licensed illustrated editions from specialty publishers with different art, but these are the more common and affordable ones from Penguin Random House &amp; HarperCollins Voyager).

And the entire series so far is also available in a very nice The Enhanced Edition for Mac/iOS devices from the Apple iTunes Store, which has handy features showing a map of where each character is at the start of their chapter (taken from _The Lands of Ice and Fire_ mapbook), a recap of what happened in the last, a character glossary recapping what happened to them in previous books, some artwork and sample passages read from the audiobooks, and some footnotes giving worldbuilding background details and trivia tidbits (mostly pulled from interview quotes and GRRM's notes given to his helpers).

All the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas are available in a graphic novel adaptation if you like comics, and so are AGOT and ACOK in collected editions (ASOS is apparently also being done, but currently unfinished).

Hope this helps!","season 7"

"202","&gt;No, I listed one complaint about the equipment they should’ve used IN the attack, and one complaint about a dragon not being used. 

Those are issues with how they led the defense of Winterfell. I don't know why you're trying to dispute that. It's OK to criticize bad writing. 

&gt;That gif of them throwing themselves off a cliff only tells Jon that they don’t rest or tire, 

It also shows that the zombie are not afraid of being injured. Humans having a fear of being trampled by 1000+ pound animals is the main reason cavalry charges work. Jon would know that sending cavalry straight into a wall of zombies wouldn't work. 

&gt;The amount in which the dead were grouped together was NOT shown in any previous episode of the series at any point

Dany estimated that she saw 100k zombies in season 7. They would have added more on their way to Winterfell. Jon would have known that 100k+ zombies attacking one castle would be a cluster fuck.","season 7"
"203","I was angry at first for awhile but then I just kinda stopped caring and now its just disappointment more than anything. To me it was watching all the theories for what couldve been and where the story was going, but the reason people were so angry was the insane amount of hype that was built through the story itself and marketing, let alone the fact we had to wait a year and a half between season 7 and 8 and then we only got 6 episodes for events that shouldve lasted 2 or 3 entire seasons at least.

People started to see flaws in s6 but to me it was a little nitpicky, like when characters started teleporting around and more plot armor it didnt really bother me too much. But I agree the last 2 episodes in s6 are some of the best in television, which made the hype for season 7 and 8 that much greater, and ultimately even more disappointing. Its interesting to see the perspective of someone watching it now though vs a couple years ago because you arent as emotionally attached to it vs the fans that watched it weekly as it came out.

Maybe even have a small storyline in season 7/8 about Dany choosing between Trystane and Jon if they wanted that.

The people didn't support Sansa. Jon was their leader. At best, any potential rebellion against Dany would split the North's forces between them.

For the sake of argument, let's say everyone in The North backed Sansa. Jon said they had ""less than 10k men"" in season 7. I don't know why they would side with Sansa in this situation, but add in the Vale forces and they would have had 12k. Dany had at least 50k. And two dragons. You don't see how Sansa ""taking the gloves off"" with Dany would be a bad idea?","season 7"
"216","It's simple... because she is the most hypocritical character portrayed within the show.

Just look at the examples:

When a captive of the Dothraki kills a Khal, she sees them as wrong and executes them for their actions... but later she herself, when captured by the Dothraki decides to kill the Khals.

She executes Mossador for taking matters into his own hands for killing a slaver outside of ""court"", but later after Selmy is killed has zero problems just executing a slaver outside of ""court"", regardless of innocence/guilt even.

Complains about being forced to marry for political gain... then forces a wrongfully imprisoned prisoner to marry her for her own political gain when it suits her agenda.

Is upset in Astapor that people are inhumanely executing for refusing to serve... later executes people who refuse to serve her in Westeros.

When she believes she has the rightful claim to the throne it is all important and she expects everyone to literally bow before her and hand her ships just because of her title... when it is discovered Jon is the rightful heir suddenly the ""rightful heir"" tag is completely meaningless in regards to who should sit on the Iron Throne and she still wants the throne for herself anyways.

Claims rulers in Westeros are corrupt/evil for what they do, then she does the exact same nonsense when she's in power... threatening Jon in regards to bending the knee , executing Tarleys for refusing to kneel, subjugating POWs through fear, etc.

I do think there's a very clear shift in her from Seasons 3 to Season 7. As you stated, in Season 3 she has people follow her because they believe in her message because her message is a just one, but in Season 7 she uses fear and power to subjugate people to follow her, like the Crown POWs and Jon

Season 3: allows the people she's freed to choose their own path.

Season 7: subjugates her subjects through fear and threat of execution.

It's a shift in her character that a lot of viewers seemingly overlooked/hand-waved away, but at the end of the day it seems fairly clear that she's just a hypocrite who hates the system when looking at it at a distance from the outside, but has zero problems abusing it to her personal gain when it benefits her.

Basically she claims she's all about free choice, but then burns anyone who doesn't agree with her.","season 7"
"217","I disagree. Pretty much all of Season 7 and 8 were terrible in comparison to the quality demonstrated previously. The story was terrible, the character development was awful, it felt like everyone knew, but they were all powerless to stop this train wreck from happening.","season 7"
"218","Between season 7 and 8: $800+++

Now: 150-300 depends on the fan/collector","season 7"
"219","I've wondered about that myself.  Yeah, the Dothraki are very skilled fighters, and they are extremely vicious, but they are, like you said, strictly light cavalry.  

In Westeros I can see them causing a lot of chaos for a while while they rampage about, but eventually Westeros would unite if only to put them down, and I honestly believe Westeros would have wrecked the Dothraki.

Honestly, if it hadn't been for Drogon breaking the Lanister lines during that battle in season 7, that fight might have gone a lot differently with a lot more dead Dothraki even if they would have still won.","season 7"
"220","Yes they are still worth watching. 

I read all the books before starting to watch them right before season 4 came out and I was a dedicated fan after that. Went to the concert (front row!) and everything. 
I am rewatching the entire series now with my boyfriend and we are currently in season 7. The one thing I didn't pick up on before-- and that had annoyed me when I first watched-- was that the subtle hints of foreshadowing in the dialogue had fallen away. In season 7 it's not so much foreshadowing as it is callbacks to season 1, which is making it more enjoyable this time around.

The boyfriend is loving this btw, and he doesn't understand why he was told to not watch it by people, so you should definitely go for it.","season 7"
"221","I will absolutely agree with this. Binge watchers, and also people who did not read the books. 

Two observations: nothing in the show was predictable. So, I assume that the writers of season 7 and 8 resisted giving viewers a foreseeable happy ending. 

Also, if you truly examine multiple elements, Dani’s end was foreshadowed multiple times. Actually, everyone’s end was. I see very little that was completely random or out of character, or even inconsistent with the nature of the show. 

Was there a lot of unresolved conflict and injustice? Absolutely. Back to my point, we’d been fed this theme all along. 

Not saying I loved it, but I didn’t have a strong expectation, so I just accepted it. 

This is also the reason I only binge shows 😂 

Can’t spend years attached to people I lose or see mistreated in a way that effs my mind.","season 7"
"222","&gt;She actually only said once there would be no civilian casualties - in 702 - and only because Tyrion argued for it.

That's not what she said and that's not what Tyrion argued for. The writers needed Dany not to use her dragons so that they could justify Cersei staying alive. They accomplished that by having Tyrion suggest that any attack on Kings Landing would end in Dany mistakenly killing tens of thousands of civilians and being the ""queen of the ashes"". Tyrion jumping to that conclusion made no sense.

That's not even getting the fact that Tyrion's blockade idea would have killed more civilians than attacking the city outright.

&gt;Seems weird to fixate on that and just ignore the times she talked about how she would destroy cities or the very clear subtext throughout Season 7 and 8 that she wanted to just smash the city and was being held back by her advisors.

That ""subtext"" was the writers using Tyrion, Varys, and Jon  to gaslight the audience by putting words in Dany's mouth. What they were doing is very obvious if you go back and watch those scenes.

&gt;YARA: If you want the Iron Throne, take it. We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons. We should hit King's Landing now. Hard. With everything we have. The city will fall within a day.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.

No one mentioned turning the dragons loose. What is Tyrion even talking about when he mentions ""fire storms""? That's not a thing. The writers were just desperate to come up with a way to explain Dany not using her best weapons.

The writers have Tyrion and Jon pull the same BS when Dany suggests burning the Red Keep.

&gt;DAENERYS: I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: We've discussed this.

Tyrion was lying here. What they had talked about was Dany attacking Kings Landing. They never talked about her burning the Red Keep. They had Tyrion lie like this so that the audience would connect Dany's new plan with what Tyrion said about her being the queen of ashes in episode 2.

Dany then asks Jon what he thinks of the idea. He responds with:

&gt;JON: ..But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same.

At no point did Dany or anyone else mention burning cities. Dany specifically asked what Jon thought about her burning the Red Keep.

The leaked outline for that scene shows that Tyrion and Jon were supposed to have an issue with Dany using her dragons on anyone. [Including enemy soldiers.](https://imgur.com/2dacXf2)

The gaslighting got painfully obvious in episode 6 of season 7. Tyrion had spent the entire season freaking out whenever Dany or anyone else brought up using the dragons. The writers seemingly forgot that and had him say this nonsense:

&gt;TYRION: Oh first she'd torture you in some horrible way, then she'd murder you. Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me. But if we go to the capital, we'll go with two armies, we'll go with three dragons, and anyone touches you, King's Landing burns down to the foundation stone.

Tyrion flip flopping like this was already bad enough. It's gets worse.

&gt;DAENERYS: And right now she's thinking of how to set a trap.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: Of course she is. And she's wondering what trap you're laying for her.  
&gt;  
&gt;DAENERYS: Are we? Laying any traps?  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: If we want to create a new and better world, I'm not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start.

Why is Tyrion talking as if Dany was the one who brought up mass murder? He was the one that had just said that they would burn all of Kings Landing in response to his sister making an attempt on Dany's life.

The writers continued doing this manipulative nonsense in season 8.

&gt;DAENERYS: Cersei will make sure they don't believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King's Landing.

Dany hadn't said anything about destroying Kings Landing.

&gt;GREY WORM: We will storm the city, my queen. We will kill your enemies. All of them.

VARYS: Cersei needs to be destroyed, but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied and the Dothraki, tens of thousands of innocents will die. That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep. These are the people you came here to protect. I beg you, Your Grace. Do not destroy the city you came to save. Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.

The idea Vary puts forward here is nonsense. The writers didn't even attempt to validate his alarmism. Dany ends up getting the city to surrender without causing any serious collateral damage. The idea that Dany was being stopped from destroy Kings Landing was always nonsense.","season 7"

Basically, imagine episode 5 of season 8 as the last of season 7. Kings Landing burning while the wall falls. Season 8 then starts with a Winterfell under siegs by the dead and John wanting to save his sister.

I really don't know why they switched the final boss around. Would it have been anticlimactic with just the white walkers? Maybe, but season 8 always was more of a last hurrah than a deep new conflict/epic emotional culmination. Well, it's too late now... :)","season 7"

"239","I think GOT addresses issues frequently (from religion to slavery to what it means to be honorable or moral to the consequences of needless violence — and that’s ignoring the overarching climate change theme) through the lenses of these characters. The show focuses on the drama of these characters’ lives but like all stories, there are thematic messages. GRRM set the stage for a wealth disparity discussion and D&amp;D kinda just didn’t follow through and that thread was just kinda forgotten, which weakened the story.

I think a character focused season 7 would have made the season better, given the constraints the writers put on themselves with the shortened season. I think it would have been a way to quickly put key characters in the right parts of their respective arcs without it feeling so empty and rushed. The established pacing was broken in season 7 anyway with characters teleporting across continents in minutes to hours. The character focused stories would have been an extreme choice maybe but it would slow the pace and deepen the intrigue. But with a few more seasons and longer seasons, the show could have just concluded normally.","season 7"

She actually only said once there would be no civilian casualties - in 702 - and only because Tyrion argued for it.

"241","The very premise of season 7 was terrible: Cersei should under no circumstances have been able to claim the throne, never mind keeping it for as long as she did.

The moment she declared herself queen, everyone in King’s Landing (and the rest of Westeros) should’ve been like ""Wtf!? That makes no sense at all! That woman has lost her mind!"" Cersei could’ve *maybe* declared herself Queen of the Westerlands, since she is Tywin’s heir and with Tommen dead, there were no legal claimants to the Iron Throne left (Dany hadn’t arrived in Westeros yet when Cersei became queen), meaning the Seven Kingdoms would’ve been separate once more. 

Instead, she declared herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, and large swathes of the nobility just seemed to accept it for some reason. From that point on, I simply couldn’t take the show seriously anymore.","season 7"

Like I legit said at the end when Danny burned the city “you know what fuck it. She deserves this. Fuck Westeros.”  And it’s true. The entire continent is just filled with trash and bad people and Danny got fucked by everyone she let into her life. I understood her motives and understood why she had to be stopped but the writing and pacing was terrible.

"252","I know there's a lot of varying theories in the nature vs. nurture debate. The problem is that the one who nurtured her from birth was Viserys, who I think we can all agree was not a good role model. When she is first shown she is quite timid and passive, but the Targaryen madness starts to leak trough early on. She lets her brother die a horrible death (granted, he kind of deserved it, but she didn't object to the cruel method). When Khal Drogo promises to raid and plunder and rape the Seven Kingdoms, she does not object, even being a victim herself. She burns Mirri Maz Duur, and enjoys it. Outside Qarth she promises she will return with fire and blood. She lets the dragons kill the undying (again, they were not good people, but still), and locks Xaro Zhoan Daxos and Doreah in that vault as soon as she realises their betrayal. At Astapor she burns the slavers (they were bad people, right?), and frees the unsullied. Granted, at Yunkai she's a bit more diplomatic, but the cruelty returns at Mereen when she crucifies those masters (slavery is horrible, surely they deserved it). Then when she is captured by the Dothraki, she burns the Khals (part of it was probably self defence, and she most likely had good reason to do so). Afterwards she takes command of the Khalasar, knowing full well that the Dothraki are a raiding and plundering people. At Mereen she burns some more slavers with the dragons, but that is understandable, as that is a battle.

Then she arrives at Westeros, and she has to face characters that we know. Her experiences have shown her that killing those she deems as enemies works out, and she believes that she is some sort of savior. So she doesn't really have any qualms about burning the westerosi. She kills the Tarlys this way, and has to be advised against just going to King's Landing with her dragons. Pretty much every time she encounters a problem throughout the show, her initial response is to kill and burn. Her advisors always stop her in time, but at the time of season 8, her trust in them is growing thin. Jorah and Barristan have died, and so did Missandei (whose final words were a callout for Daenerys to burn her enemies). Two of her children die in a short span of time, making her more unstable. Varys betrays her, and Tyrions openly doubts her more and more. Jon is loyal, but she is unable to trust him after she learns of his lineage (even though he is adamant he does not want to push his claims). That leaves Grey Worm, and he becomes hell bent on revenge after Missandei is killed.

So no, Daenerys would never be a good ruler. As a matter of fact, she'd be among the worst rulers of the Seven Kingdoms, right next to Maegor the Cruel, Aegon the Unworthy, Joffrey Baratheon/Lannister and her own father, the Mad King. Her reign would be one of fire and blood, and the innocent and guilty would suffer alike.","season 8"

"254","The problem goes much deeper. They couldn't adapt book 4 completely, because it's for the most part unrelated to the main story. Feast for Crows feels like a spinoff within the series. You can see this in the narrative structure: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire#Narrative_structure

It's essentially a book about Cersei, Jamie, Brienne, Sam(!) and the Greyjoys. If you turn this into a full season, you ratings will take a dive even worse than during season 8. It was correct to merge it with Dance of Dragons. Last but not least, GRRM doesn't need time to finish the series, he needs motivation.","season 8"

"256","&gt;Obviously she had a traumatic childhood, but she does become utterly obsessed with revenge and murder, to the point she ends up baking an entire house into a pie. 

Couple things: first off she did not ""bake an entire house into a pie"".. it was like a person or two. Yes, still super bizarre, no doubt, but that brings me to the second thing. 

The ""Frey Pie"" is an easter egg from the books that they have shoehorned into Arya's character. She doesn't do it in the books, but because the Northern politics are less prevalent in the show, they just gave her that action because she's a named character. 

Just saying it's not something that they wrote into the script because they believed her character was building up to this point... merely took what another family did and slapped it on her character.   

&gt;\&gt; Yet people cheer for her big time and very rarely point out how completly psychopatic her character arc is.

I think there's a huge gap between characters like Dany and Arya in regards to 'madness' or 'psychopathic tendencies' though. Dany, multiple times, has shown a capacity for genocide multiple times even before Season 8, literally claiming she would kill thousands of innocent people simply because she's pissed, whereas Arya just refused to kill a single innocent person and was nearly killed for such a refusal. 

That's two clearly different states of mind at play here. Sure, Arya kills a lot of people, but because of that Stark code of honor mixed with Yorren's list, she comes off as a much more stable and justice-focussed character.

Like, we see her spare the Frey women and children because she knows they weren't involved with the Red Wedding... it's not like she's just out for everyone's blood at times like Dany was. 

I think it's fine to raise an eyebrow and keep a close eye on Arya, sure, but labeling her a psycho simply because she seeks justice for the murder of her mother/brother/countrymen seems a bit of a stretch.","season 8"

And knowing that HBO &amp; GRRM himself felt the show needed multiple more seasons (minimum 10 seasons according to GRRM IIRC) to wrap things up, but D&amp;D decided to rush through it so they could continue advancing their careers with franchises like Star Wars… What is there even to debate? D&amp;D clearly rushed to wrap the series up to suit their career ambitions and the quality suffered. It’s not rocket science…..","season 8"
"270","&gt;She had everything she wanted and just opted for senseless cruelty.

If you honestly believe this then you need to revisit Season 8, as the last season clearly implodes Dany's entire world around her, leading her to a point where her psyche seems to be broken, as she is clearly a shell of her former self... she certainly did not have 'everything she wanted' as you mistakenly believe.

Her support structure crumbles through emotional deaths and perhaps even more emotional betrayals.

Her hopes, dreams, and beliefs are all shattered through Jon's heritage reveal (she's not *The Chosen One* as she believed) and the realization that Westeros doesn't love her.

Practically all remaining relationships have turned to ash in her mouth, as Jon doesn't want to pursue a romantic relationship and everyone else has basically died because of her actions or has betrayed her in some sense.

This so clearly is not *everything she wanted.*

What she wanted was to be The Chosen One, the Rightful Heir, with the people of Westeros adoring her, not unlike her time in Slaver's Bay. But that so clearly was not something she would be able to obtain once Jon's heritage was revealed/secret was out... hence she chooses Fear instead.

I agree a couple more episodes would have helped some pacing issues with every single arc, but I think it is fairly clear that this situation is so far removed from what she has built up in her head... this is not what she wanted, or rather the situation surrounding winning the Throne is so far from ideal that she states ""Let it be Fear.""

&gt;\&gt; This kind of total lunacy is the type of thing that would rightfully take years longer to build up to.

Which they ~~absolutely~~ *for the most* part did.

They have laid a fair amount of groundwork for this path across Dany's arc.

They show she has this Fire and Blood persona all the time. She literally screams that she will take what she wants with Fire and Blood. She cooly watches as people are inhumanely executed. She kills people who are innocent when she's pissed.  Her advisors, constantly, tell her to chill out/tone it down.

They have shown, *multiple times*, a very clear willingness/capacity to raze entire cities because she believes the ends justify the means.

And most of this happens during her time in Essos, where she is clearly trying to do good. But her doing good doesn't magically erase that Fire and Blood persona.

And her time in Westeros simply tears down the psyche of this young adult with a family history of mental issues and who herself had an incredibly fucked-up upbringing.

This is a person who has threatened to raze entire cities multiple times previously... and now her world is crumbling in upon itself.

If someone who threatened to shoot up a school multiple times, then fell on incredibly hard times (loses support relationships, lifelong goals/dreams shattered, promising relationships gone, etc), would you be shocked to learn that person shot up a school?

Not really, right? Because the pre-cursors, like literally threatening this very act multiple times previously, are there... the groundwork for such an act is there.

Just like it was with Dany.

"273","&gt;Yes he can go back on honour for his love but the writing needs to be in a way that makes it a big deal. It felt like I’m going back to Cersi and all I cared about was poor Brienne.

Sure, like all of Season 8, it could have been written better, absolutely. I certainly wouldn't claim it was written/executed masterfully... merely that this arc makes absolute sense for his character. There is nothing surprising/shocking/out of character for this person to return to the person he has a literal life-long bond with. Sleeping with another woman one time doesn't magically undo a 40+ year bond, as some people seem to think.

That said, I would actually argue that him basically sacrificing his life/future just to be with Cersei one last time is arguably a culmination of his ""honor"" arc, considering it may be the most honorable thing he's done on-screen... sacrificing his future just to be with his sister/lover one last time in her hour of need.

I mean, if the roles were reversed and he left Cersei to be with Brienne one last time, everyone would cheer it and love it and talk about ""honor"", but because the names are reversed and the viewer is meant to be disappointed, suddenly the act itself is overlooked as being 'honorable.'

&gt;\&gt; So Danerys arc and development she kills evil people, so slavers ect. But the slavers she killed hanged corpses on crosses so quite evil. The sons of harpy killed her friends army and devastated the city. But no there’s innocent people their so I’m not going to kill everyone. What’s even better here is it didn’t even come up as an option.

This is a character who has, very clearly, shown a willingness/capacity to commit widespread genocide over entire cities, innocents and all, multiple times. That's fact.

She absolutely has inhumanely executed innocent people, multiple times. That's fact.

She, herself, stated she was going to raze Astapor and Yunkai before Tyrion had to stop her from doing so. That's fact.

Her world completely imploded across Season 8 (support structure crumbled, hopes and dreams shattered, relationships turned to ash in her mouth) and she seemingly reached a boiling point where that Fire and Blood persona was finally fulfilling the very threat she's meaningfully made previous times before.

And to be clear, I'm not dismissing all the good she did in Seasons 3, 4 and 5... merely pointing out that she is a character with two clearly distinct and warring personas... *conflict within the human heart* and all. Yes, she has a kind-hearted persona, no doubt, but she so clearly has this Fire and Blood persona that threatens to erupt multiple times long before Season 8... and as her hopes and dreams are soured that Fire and Blood persona threatens to be unleashed in full force... which it eventually was.

It's there. On-screen. The groundwork absolutely was laid for this potential arc. If you honestly don't see it, I would recommend revisiting the show with fresh eyes and an unbiased stance, as plenty of people have pointed out these very issues in regards to Dany for years... long before Season 8 ever aired.

Sure, a couple more episodes would have helped with pacing, no doubt, but her arc constitutes a huge path of red flags... even across Essos when she was doing her 'best work.'

"279","Dany and Jamie scenes.

Some viewers sure love to whinge about how those character arcs ended, but seemingly tend to forget/are unaware that their actions/choices in the end absolutely have had the groundwork laid for them across their entire arc leading up to Season 8.

Some people, over time, seemingly placed these two characters on some pedestal where only some grand animated Disney resolution would suffice, but, on-screen, these characters are portrayed as gray characters capable of both great and terrible acts, often based on both great and terrible choices.

Dany so often shows this Fire and Blood persona throughout her arc (as her advisors constantly tell her to tone it down) and her relationship with *power* becomes an increasingly suspect one, as when she doesn't have it she curses those who abuse it, but then as she gains power seemingly abuses it herself. Her whole arc is a series of hypocritical words/acts mixed with this fiery persona building up to a boiling point as her world comes crashing down upon her during her time in Westeros.

Also, people love to claim that her ""entire story"" revolved around helping the innocent, but that wasn't really the case, as it was a temporary goal of hers from midway in Season 3 (she literally went to Slaver's Bay in order to specifically purchase fighting slaves) to the end of Season 5 (when she rides off on Drogon.) That's it... aside from one single episode in Season 6, so maybe 25 episodes out of 70+. It's a nice arc, and certainly helps show off one side to her character (that many fans latched onto) but hardly an ""entire story"" as tends to get parroted. She spends Seasons 1, 2, half of 3, 7 and 8 trying to win the Iron Throne for herself... clearly a majority of her on-screen time.

As for Jaime, he so clearly has this soft spot for Cersei and literal life-long bond with her that I'm surprised so many people were gobsmacked by his decision. He literally spends 7+ seasons doing anything/everything for her while not giving two fucks about anyone not named Lannister (or Brienne), but people seemingly are surprised that he went back to her simply because he slept with someone else once over 40+ years? And are surprised that he stated that he didn't care about people, despite it being pretty obvious for 7+ seasons that he didn't care about people. I mean, there are specific scenes when he is with Cersei when he literally states that he doesn't care about anyone else, but somehow people think their own personal head canon/interpretation of the bath scene magically supercedes what he literally states on-screen about the commonfolk.

I honestly believe if you review these two characters with an open mind and fresh eyes, that Season 8 is not ""as bad"" as many people claim. Sure, the last seasons will always be a bit rough, but I think having a unbiased understanding of these two characters will help anyone understand how these two arcs end by shedding a neutral light on how these characters got to this point.","season 8"

I am also a believer that even if the ending season is bad in a series I have to watch it such as That 70s Show, Lost, TVD etc. It is always good to find out how the writers want to end the show. As well as that, if I rewatch these shows I usually just skip the last season, but I feel that every series is worth at least one full watch. I don’t think you’d regret watching the last season.

I was giving you an example of a technically amazing movie with shit writing, to make the point that a show isn't about it's technical achievements.  You can make a cake that looks amazing, but if it doesn't taste good then it's not a good cake.  GOT season 8 looks amazing, and no one is arguing that it doesn't.    Your reading comprehension is incredibly low and I'm guessing this is why the terrible stupid writing of season 8 doesn't bother you.

"301","Not downvoting, but my sense is a few people tolerate it / came to like it ok, while most people thought it was terrible.  Honestly I've never seen anything resembling the degree of consensus there's been on GOT season 8 on any show (no matter how bad) so I think simply calling it 'divisive' is a bit misleading...

Can you find things to like in it? sure... but the character writing was just so bad.  You can come round to it, but you basically have to think about it as a different show or else massively lower your standards - which is my basic understanding of why it might become tolerable on a rewatch, even though it was intolerable to basically everyone who watched it on release.  ((Like there was... basically a global consensus that it was s\*\*\* compared to what came before.  Never seen anything like that before or sense xD ))

Edit: d\_unit4595 summed this up super well actually.  It's ""like going into a Marvel film and expecting Breaking Bad or The Wire level of writing"".  But the thing was, its audience as a whole /was/ expecting good writing, and not a marvel movie finish to a series that we not only loved, but was at times intensely painful to watch precisely because of how non-Marvel it was.","season 8"

"303","I feel you. I shifted my expectations after the show surpassed the book content. Around season 6 (which is a season I still love) I noticed it slowly start inching into the standard Hollywood action movie level of writing the more that D&amp;D, your typical Hollywood writers, got more creative control. More shortcuts in the story were being taken, plot conveniences started occurring more, survival capabilities started turning more into comic book movie level. For me, it was never to the extent that it ruined the seasons and the positives of those seasons always outweighed the negatives. And I personally feel the same with season 8. Even though the tonal shift was a bit jarring due to what the show was for the first 4 or 5 seasons. Even then, especially since the issues I listen above really took a toll on S7, going into season 8 stressing over every detail wasn’t necessary. That’s like going into a Marvel film and expecting Breaking Bad or The Wire level of writing. Not saying it’s right, and I’m not saying the season shouldn’t have been fleshed out way better, but just because it could’ve been way better doesn’t mean we still got a dumpster fire of a season like some seem to act like. And I think more people are noticing this as they rewatch the series.

For me, it’s more of a case of I’m not going to let a few unideal things ruin the show I spent years of my life enjoying, especially when in my eyes, there was a lot in those seasons I could enjoy. And it was more than just the spectacle. I liked where all the character arcs ended up even if getting there was a tad clumsy.","season 8"

&gt;Finally shes willing to take a public stand for something (Northern Independence)that many of the people around her want.

I'm going to guess this wasn't an intentional choice by D&amp;D, but The Northmen didn't earnestly want independence. They were, at best, opportunist. The northern lords would have helped Jon and Sansa get rid of Ramsey if they actually wanted independence. The Starks had 405 northmen on their side while Ramsey had 5k+. 

&gt;Those things give her power.

One of the sillier retcons between seasons 7 and 8 is Sansa's shifting opinion of the northern lords. Here's what she said to Littlefinger when he was trying to get her to betray Jon:

&gt;*SANSA: Yes, they turned their backs on Jon when it was time to retake Winterfell and then they named him their king and now they're ready to turn their backs on him again. How far would you trust men like that? They're all bloody wind vanes*.

So either they had staff writers that were uncredited that were actually good writers.

&gt;Lol, just because a line is spoken doesn't magically make it some ironclad truth... wild that 8 seasons of Game of Thrones hasn't taught you that.  
&gt;  
&gt;I mean, you seemingly claim a character's word is ironclad and cherry-pick some quote as if it's gospel, but when I point out that she, multiple times STATED ON-SCREEN she going to kill thousands upon thousands of innocents because she wanted to, that doesn't count in your eyes? Only the quotes you cherry pick matter or count as canon or can be construed as fact? Any quotes that disprove your quotes magically don't count because Dany reasons?  
&gt;  
&gt;Talk about bad faith discussion.  


I got plenty of more, ""I am not my father."" ""I am not here to be queen of the Ashes."" ""Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city."" ""I don't want another child's bones dropped at my feet."" ""I am a queen, not a butcher.""   


And how am I cherry-picking? My point wasn't ""This is everything Danny has ever said this proves my point and your quote was fabricated."" That would be ridiculous.  


You brought up the scene where she threatens to burn all the wise masters cities while watching them attack her city and trying to burn it down. My point is that my quotes are just as viable as yours, and arguably more so since she actually acted on these, she did free the slaves, she chained up her dragons, and she only made the city-destroying threats for betrayal such as when the master broke a promise and attacked, or when Yunki and Astapor were retaken by them. The people of Kingslanding have not done anything of the sort and even still despite the masters being the worse and honestly even I would have defended her if she whipped them out she didn't likely not just for moral reasons but practicality as well as listening to Tyrion got her the ships she needed to sail to Westeros and abandon Mereen, which is an issue itself but I am trying to focus on season 8 and the shit stain that it is. 

&gt;I mean, if in one scene a character says they would never kill someone, then in multiple other scenes they clearly state they would kill someone, can you honestly defend the theory that they would never kill someone?  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course not.  


Here is the thing, I am not saying Danny would never kill someone, hell she smothered her own husband, she burned hundred of soldiers to death, no killing isn't my issue, good character like Jon have killed people, and it was much more hands on, but does that mean I can picture him ordering his men to sack and burn villages, cutting the throats of the smallfolk or turning them to ash on a Dragon? Hell no, and hey you know what, it would make more sense for Jon to do this than Danny because Jon actually has killed a kid with his own hands.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's not that complex... she's like a tea kettle. Over time the pressure builds and builds until that pressure literally reaches a boiling point. We know she has this Fire and Blood persona bubbling up underneath, Season 8 completely implodes her entire world, her psyche is shot and that Fire and Blood persona is no longer 'contained', and she reaches this emotional climax where that Fire and Blood persona hits a violent boiling point.  


You do know that by comparisons achieving boiling water takes longer then Danny falling into madness. At least then I can see the still water, then some bubbles forming at the bottom, every once in a while rising to the top until it does finally reach said boiling point and I can finally put the pasta in.   


Now I can agree, she has gone through a lot, I think they portrayed these tragic events poorly and it comes off more that she will kill everyone because Jon wouldn't fuck her rather than the grief of losing her dragon and Misandi, but my argument would be why is Danny so much weaker than everyone else?  


Jon, Sansa, and Arya have arguably gone through just as hard of times if not worse then Danny and are still somewhat mentally sound, the most fucked up being Arya but even she saw what Danny did and smartly said ""I no a killer when I see one."" WOW THANKS ARYA WE NEVER WOULD HAVE FIGURED THAT OUT!!! Shit getting of topic again.  


But if that doesn't work for you since they are different characters then lets just look at the shit that Danny when through season, her child turned into a stillborn and her husband a vegetable by a women who she tried to save, her kindness and trust resulting in losing two things very important to her. Dare I say that scene has far more justification for her to go mad but she keeps to her more kind-hearted nature and goes on her mission to free the slaves. 

&gt;Sure, I think the show would have benefitted from more episodes to help with some pacing issues, absolutely.. but there's enough 'dots' to connect to see the picture... even if the picture isn't as detailed as it probably could have been.  


Idk about that, with how much of a mess season 5-7 were, I feel like the dots you're saying are there to connect are just 6 points that make you draw a pointy mountain and the book tells you it's a castle. 

&gt;\&gt; for it saved many of the innocents in kingslanding, otherwise why do it?  
&gt;  
&gt;Wait... are you serious?  
&gt;  
&gt;How about to save his father? To save Lannister forces? To save himself? TO help the Lannisters gain power? Because he fucking hates Aerys and what he did to people both behind closed doors and in public?  
&gt;  
&gt;If you honestly believe the only benefit for him to kill the Mad King was solely to help the commoners, you desperately need to revisit the actual story, because  ALL THE REASONS make sense for why Jaime did what he did... not just the single one you've cherry-picked and pretend is some sole reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;I mean, he literally mentions 'father' first in the bath scene question he proposes to Brienne... clearly there is more than a single reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again, you're cherry-picking here and pretending like nothing else exists surrounding the issue... bad faith.  


I will admit that those reasons were part of it, yet the key component that can hold up to scrutiny is his want to save the people. For example, he never had a great relationship with his father and it only got worse when he joined the KG.  
Saving the Lannister forces would coincide with saving the people, after all if he dose not care about the small folk why would he care about his fathers soldiers? Not to mention he actually fights against them to defend the red keep which would likely be to defend what smallfolk were able to retreat into the castle. And of course he hated Aerys we don't often kill people we like, unless your Danny, or Jon, or Tyrion, oh shit Jamie killed his cousin (I got my issues with that scene as well) so maybe he didn't hate Aryes.   


And as far as saving himself there were plenty of moments he could have just gotten away without risking his life, even in a way so that his ""honor"" would be intact much like Baristan. Running away and coming back after saying he fought hard and barely survived the wildfire eruption.   
Protecting the smallfolk is what holds up best under scrutiny when you look to his actions even after the events before we see much development with him, stepping in to save Brienne from getting raped, jumping into a bear pit to save her, armoring her and arming her to go find and save Sansa.","season 8"
"322","It’s a good point and generally I would agree. But I also think there’s something to be said about ruminating on things and spinning wild theories over the course of years. Season 8 in particular had a 2 year gap. People went wild. I think it’s the opposite extreme of binge watching. Some of the theories I heard sounded so insane to me even at the time. I kept warning people to lower their expectations.","season 8"
"323","Season 8 is a lot more palatable to binge watchers. In my experience, they can still see the flaws in it, but they look at it a lot more objectively and it doesn’t ruin the show for them. The years of anticipation worked against the show and I think all the hype and expectation building (a lot of it self inflicted by the fans themselves) set the bar unacheivably high. 

The final season for sure failed to meet its full potential 100%….but I will die on the hill that the expectations from people watching it live were unreasonably high.","season 8"
"324","&gt;She actually only said once there would be no civilian casualties - in 702 - and only because Tyrion argued for it.

That's not what she said and that's not what Tyrion argued for. The writers needed Dany not to use her dragons so that they could justify Cersei staying alive. They accomplished that by having Tyrion suggest that any attack on Kings Landing would end in Dany mistakenly killing tens of thousands of civilians and being the ""queen of the ashes"". Tyrion jumping to that conclusion made no sense.

That's not even getting the fact that Tyrion's blockade idea would have killed more civilians than attacking the city outright.

&gt;Seems weird to fixate on that and just ignore the times she talked about how she would destroy cities or the very clear subtext throughout Season 7 and 8 that she wanted to just smash the city and was being held back by her advisors.

That ""subtext"" was the writers using Tyrion, Varys, and Jon  to gaslight the audience by putting words in Dany's mouth. What they were doing is very obvious if you go back and watch those scenes.

&gt;YARA: If you want the Iron Throne, take it. We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons. We should hit King's Landing now. Hard. With everything we have. The city will fall within a day.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.

No one mentioned turning the dragons loose. What is Tyrion even talking about when he mentions ""fire storms""? That's not a thing. The writers were just desperate to come up with a way to explain Dany not using her best weapons.

The writers have Tyrion and Jon pull the same BS when Dany suggests burning the Red Keep.

&gt;DAENERYS: I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: We've discussed this.

Tyrion was lying here. What they had talked about was Dany attacking Kings Landing. They never talked about her burning the Red Keep. They had Tyrion lie like this so that the audience would connect Dany's new plan with what Tyrion said about her being the queen of ashes in episode 2.

Dany then asks Jon what he thinks of the idea. He responds with:

&gt;JON: ..But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same.

At no point did Dany or anyone else mention burning cities. Dany specifically asked what Jon thought about her burning the Red Keep.

The leaked outline for that scene shows that Tyrion and Jon were supposed to have an issue with Dany using her dragons on anyone. [Including enemy soldiers.](https://imgur.com/2dacXf2)

The gaslighting got painfully obvious in episode 6 of season 7. Tyrion had spent the entire season freaking out whenever Dany or anyone else brought up using the dragons. The writers seemingly forgot that and had him say this nonsense:

&gt;TYRION: Oh first she'd torture you in some horrible way, then she'd murder you. Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me. But if we go to the capital, we'll go with two armies, we'll go with three dragons, and anyone touches you, King's Landing burns down to the foundation stone.

Tyrion flip flopping like this was already bad enough. It's gets worse.

&gt;DAENERYS: And right now she's thinking of how to set a trap.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: Of course she is. And she's wondering what trap you're laying for her.  
&gt;  
&gt;DAENERYS: Are we? Laying any traps?  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: If we want to create a new and better world, I'm not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start.

Why is Tyrion talking as if Dany was the one who brought up mass murder? He was the one that had just said that they would burn all of Kings Landing in response to his sister making an attempt on Dany's life.

The writers continued doing this manipulative nonsense in season 8.

&gt;DAENERYS: Cersei will make sure they don't believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King's Landing.

Dany hadn't said anything about destroying Kings Landing.

&gt;GREY WORM: We will storm the city, my queen. We will kill your enemies. All of them.

VARYS: Cersei needs to be destroyed, but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied and the Dothraki, tens of thousands of innocents will die. That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep. These are the people you came here to protect. I beg you, Your Grace. Do not destroy the city you came to save. Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.

The idea Vary puts forward here is nonsense. The writers didn't even attempt to validate his alarmism. Dany ends up getting the city to surrender without causing any serious collateral damage. The idea that Dany was being stopped from destroy Kings Landing was always nonsense.","season 8"

The people who are genuinely mad at how it ended are the people that felt it was too rushed and that 6 slightly longer episodes didn’t do an entire season (at least) worth of storytelling any justice. 

The series always gave the viewer room to breathe in between the big moments. Nothing ever felt like it was moving too quickly, and the slower paced moments always had meaning. They led to something. They gave you anticipation and allowed the viewer to become invested in the story. 

Season 8 abandoned nearly everything that made the show what it was originally. Sure, it had a ton of great moments and the acting was superb as usual but the show deserved more than what we got. Both seasons 7 and 8 deserved 10 episodes each. Then it would have likely felt like it didn’t sprint to the end.","season 8"

However, aside from that stupid interview, the main issue with scenes like this is now made plain to me again by watching it - that a lot of this dialogue is quite out of character, bearing attitudes that are not adequately set up, breaking the immersion with how hard the writers were trying to warp the characters around what they wanted to do without putting in the hard yards to make it make sense. Effectively a shift from character-driven storytelling of earlier seasons to plot-driven characters.

Season 8 then starts with a Winterfell under siegs by the dead and John wanting to save his sister.

I really don't know why they switched the final boss around. Would it have been anticlimactic with just the white walkers? Maybe, but season 8 always was more of a last hurrah than a deep new conflict/epic emotional culmination. Well, it's too late now... :)","season 8"

The biggest/loudest complaint about the final season seems to be something about *""character assassination/Character X ruined""*, but the groundwork for every arc (aside from Bran's) has been laid across the previous 70+ episodes. Dany's descent and capacity/willingness to raze entire cities because of that Fire and Blood persona. Jaime not giving two fucks about the common folk. Jon absolutely not wanting power or to deal with Westerosi politics. It's all clearly portrayed on-screen for the 80 hours leading up to the finale.

Sure, the quality of Season 8 was clearly sub-par, no argument there, as the writing definitely took a dip, but a huge majority of the character arcs certainly make sense when viewed through an unbiased lens, especially upon a rewatch.

Wish everyone were able to follow in your footsteps and revisit the story with fresh eyes, as I think a lot of issues were overlooked due to personal biases or simply missing details the first time through, so props to you for taking the plunge... hope you feel 'rewarded' for your efforts.

PS - *'lowkey satisfied'* is the perfect way to describe how it all wrapped up... nailed it!","season 8"

"341","God's the final two episodes of season 6 were amazing, the hype was off the chart, why could they have not got the ending right, makes me sad I would have rewatched that show over and over for the rest of my life it really was top tier TV until season 8","season 8"
"342","Scenes like this still give me chills….but damn does that sour taste of season 8 linger to the point of not being able to start a rewatch yet.","season 8"
"343","That is a very good point.  I guess I always thought she was going to overthrow the government but “fire and blood” has probably never benefited the average pleb.  I’m going through the books now for the first time (I’m on a storm go swords) and I am looking for all the hints of Dany-was-always-going-to-mad.  And I think you’re also right re:Targaryen…Aeres (spelling?? The mad king) from what a gather was a pretty normal lad and hung out with Tywin and (maybe) Stephon Baratheon and then went nutso with age and power.  Makes sense Dany would do the same.  

 I still hate season 8 though. (Except the costumes).","season 8"
"344","I think it's an issue of spectacle over substance.

For example, I thought the ""Field of Fire"" where Daenerys torched the Lannister soldiers was visually impressive, but character motivations, their decisions and the weight of their actions started to feel nonsensical.

I remember that I liked the first few episodes well enough, but the more I think of it, the more frustrated I got. That was even before Season 8.","season 8"
"345","What was wrong with Game of Thrones? People made the mistake of trying to look at it as “a work of art” when it was really just a money-making venture. Everybody involved in it got tired of it before the audience did and wanted to move on. If the people who make it get sick of it, how is the audience supposed to care? After getting paid a fabulous sum in advance for it, George R.R. Martin got tired of writing it and simply stopped writing it. Even today, he keeps saying he’s going to finish it, but no one believes him any more.

After he stopped writing, Benioff and Weiss were forced to write original material, something they really sucked at. Season 8 showed they have no talent in this area at all. When George opted out, the two faux writers decided to take GOT out behind the barn and shoot it. They did this in such a hurried and shoddy way that even the normally unperceptive and not swift audience took notice, and their was endless moaning and complaining about it. It was a huge debacle. George R.R. Martin cared Nothing for the outcry, Benioff and Weiss even less, and HBO least of all, because all of these entities made huge pots of money, the only reason that this whole cash cow was made. HBO was pleased to win the Emmy, not so pleased that half their viewership evaporated after GOT was gone.

Now it’s in the past, although the disappointment of the former fans still lingers. Audience, as long as you continue to put up with shoddy work, you are going to continue to get shoddy work for like Forever. Perhaps scrutinize the “next big epic” very closely before getting too involved. Amazon’s new LOTR movie, for instance. And of course, The Three Body Problem.","season 8"

But still some episodes are good, some bad . But one thing i liked is that a lot of characters get to meet each other. Also i didn't start season 8, will start today and hearing overall it's bad but some people say the first 3 episodes are ok","season 8"
"348","She wanted to break the wheel. Her description of the wheel is spokes that go round and round vying for power. To take out the spokes means her on top with zero dissent. Her views around dissent and how she deals with it make up the bulk of her story in Maareen; those that did not love her dethroned her. It was only with Fire and Blood, stamping them out, burning the slavers ships (which is of note in itself; previously she had waged war in a way as to not flambe slaves, it is only after she follows through with her threats that Maareen is truely 'won') to force a peace.

When she arrived in Westeros she had a strong claim, 3 dragons (who were difficult to kill) , a complete army of unsullied slaves and the horde army in the Dothraki. She was in a comfortable position, she had that much firepower its easy to be content and wait. There wasn't anyone who couldn't actually threaten her.

By the end she was in a much weaker position had a single dragon, half her army, her claim was being questioned by those who wanted Jon on the throne, along with the fact her closest 'friends' (and I'd argue she never had any friends, Missandei and Grey worm were in their minds repaying a debt and planning their life after Daenerys) were gone, and Westeros has weapon advancements that threatened the last remaining dragon.

Visares introduces the Machiavellian concept of 'Who can rule without fear or love?' in season 1. Danys entire story explores this, the point in Essos isn't to show us Dany like freeing slaves so much (there's really no need for 5 seasons of that...)  , more her situation, she is ruling over two peoples one with extreme version of love and one with a more extreme dislike, how she handles and ultimately resolves this feed into the finale.

During S8 she becomes disillusioned with Westerosi people. She does not believe she will be accepted, or loved. Her weak position makes her act more rash - going for Kings landing so soon after the battle at Winterfell is a form of desperation because she feels her power slipping away. In Essos she had a hard enough time controlled a percent of the population who rebelled.

By the time she leaves Winterfell she is erratic, acting irrationally, paranoid and delusional because of her state and slipping power. Losing another dragon only makes this worse. She can not rule without fear or love and she decides fear it is.

Burning it all is a more effective fear than just removing one person in power. Like the masters she needs to teach them she is willing to go Fire and Blood. The masters surrenders once and what good did that do her? She knows taking and sitting on a throne isn't a guarantee of power, she's been there. Power resides where men believe it resides.

Otherwise, Daenerys other characterisations allowed her to do this. While she has an affinity for freeing the enslaved, she also believes herself to be a sort of divine being, a fair number of her speeches before Season 8 go a bit *manifest destiny,* much of her final speech to her followers are all things we'd heard before but didn't have the same context.  Her long list of titles and general narcissism is best displayed in the scene where she meets Jon snow and talks about how faith in herself kept her going because she is special *'This is Jon snow... hes King in the North'* works as comic relief because the former was so self important and grandiose.

In S6 she's speaking with Hizdahr at the fighting pits and it's a really good dialogue into how far she is willing to go and *why;*

Daenerys - one day your great city will return to the dirt as well

Hizdahr - At your command?

Daenerys -- If needs be.

Hizdahr - And how many will die to make that happen?

Daenerys - if it comes to that, they will have died for a good reason.

Hizdahr - those men think they are dying for a good reason

Daenerys - - Someone elses reason

Daenerys didn't really change. Her situation did and she decided that now needs be, justified to herself by those that are dying are dying for a good reason (her reason), which she has long believed but previously not required (in her mind) .. Ultimately her want for unrivalled conquest was more important to her than the lives of those people, that is the conflict in Dany. The tragedy is it wouldn't have happened without the WW and Jon saga, the scary thing is she was always capable of deciding needs must.","season 8"
"349","They knew how they wanted to end it, but had no clue how they were going to get there. They’ve admitted this in interviews and allude to it in the post episode interviews. I don’t think it’s wrong to have fun reading theories. And the reason I am disappointed in the end of the series (seasons 7 &amp; 8) has nothing to do with my “internal fan fiction.” The series is incredibly complex and I assumed my ideas not even coming close to what they’d create because my imagination never reached that of GRRMS. The disappointment in a rushed ending with terrible dialogue and complete lack of character development is valid. You can disagree with me, that’s why it’s an opinion not fact. You even acknowledge they discussed the main characters but by season 8, all of the side characters became main ones and they didn’t have stories anymore. Brienne, Cersei, onion knight, Missandei, grey worm, Varys, the red woman, and so many others. So many stories that had development over the years just went nowhere imo. And watching interviews where d&amp;d comment that they didn’t really have a solid plan throughout is tough to hear.","season 8"
"350","&gt; They wouldn’t show up to a con because they didn’t want to answer fan questions after season 8. They’ve literally admitted to not knowing where to take the story and there was never a plan for how to end while the seasons were going, which is insane in my opinion.

GRRM said he gave D&amp;D his planned endings for all the major characters when D&amp;D spent two months with him in New Mexico getting their scripts to line up with his plans for the books.  HBO did want more GoT, but after D&amp;D explained their plans for the end of the series, HBO signed off on it happening that way.

You don't have to like their plans, but to deny that they even existed is a bit odd.

One of the worst things anyone could do in GoT was subscribe to fan theories.  IMO much of the dislike for the ending of the series came from viewers who expected to see their internal fan fiction on the screen and were angered when that didn't happen.  That the disgruntled faction is still indulging in this nonsense over three years after the end of the show is astonishing.","season 8"
"351","First off, might want to dispel the notion that her entire identity was about freeing slaves and realize that literally most of her screentime was spent pursuing power for herself. 

Seasons 1, 2, and the beginning of 3? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. Seasons 7 and 8? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. So 4.5 seasons of conquering versus less than 3 about freeing slaves (back half of Season 3, Season 4, Season 5, one episode in Season 6.. the clear minority.)

Her time in Slaver's Bay was a single arc, not some 'whole' identity. 

That said, I think a fresh and unbiased rewatch always helps paint a clearer picture of the issue. 

Season 8 completely implodes her world around her. If you see her psyche as a Jenga tower, it's easy to see how it becomes increasingly unstable throughout the final season until it is this unstable, teetering structure that finally topples over in an emotional moment. 

Her support structure crumbles (deaths, betrayals), her hopes and dreams and beliefs shattered (Jon's heritage reveal, she's not the Chosen One, Westeros doesn't love her) and her promising relationships all sour (killed, betrayed, Jon's romantic relationship ends.)

Keep in mind she's a young adult with a fucked-up upbringing (sold, raped, etc) with a Fire and Blood persona and family history of mental issues. Her entire world comes crashing down on her in a short amount of time, and this is a person who, has literally stated from her own mouth multiple times previously that she is capable/willing to raze entire cities if she feels the ends justify the means. 

She clearly states, in the latter episodes an increasingly deteriorated mental state, that she now sees the people of King's Landing as 'supporting' Cersei (ie, enemies) and that she has decided to ""Rule by Fear.""

Then, once she sees the Red Keep, that Jenga tower that's been teetering on a single piece because of all the other pieces that once held it in place are missing, finally topples over, and that Fire and Blood persona that's been bubbling up all this time is finally unleashed in full force. 

Wish we could have gleaned more context from the scene if we could have seen her as she razed part of King's Landing, but unfortunately we didn't get to see her again until the aftermath in the next episode.","season 8"
"352","The two people are the creators d&amp;d. There is a big theory that after season 8 was panned and fans were disappointed in how they finished the series they were completely over game of thrones. HBO wanted them to have more seasons but they were over it and ready to move on to a Star Wars project (which eventually fell through). They wouldn’t show up to a con because they didn’t want to answer fan questions after season 8. They’ve literally admitted to not knowing where to take the story and there was never a plan for how to end while the seasons were going, which is insane in my opinion. They cameoed in westworld killing Drogon showing they don’t give a shit about thrones fandom, etc. — I’m not saying any of this is fact obviously.

Back when GoT was at its best people were always debating and discussing cool new lore reveals and this utterly new reveal that Aegon actually conquered Westeros because he foresaw The Long Night is *awesome* and only adds to the world building and history!","season 8"

"367","I came into the show having read the books first, so it was easier to follow. If I hadn't read the books I would never have watched the show. But the downside to this is that only 5 books have been published so far. I don’t think books 7 and 8 will ever see the light of day.

If you're itching to get started on HoTD, you shouldn't let not having seen the other one stop you. You could also read Fire and Blood (put it on hold at your library, but at mine the wait list is long) and then decide from there.

If you choose to watch GoT here's something to keep in mind:

Season 8 broke my heart, but not in the way a sad story will. It will make you distance yourself from your favourite characters because the showrunners were in a hurry to finish things up. If you can keep this in mind and not get too attached, it's a beautiful story.

I haven't the heart to watch HoTD just yet. I'm probably going to wait until a few seasons are over.","season 8"

"380","It's exactly the pilot this show needed.

The dialog is worlds better than late GoT but not quite up to the level of early GoT, but that is to be expected because they can't just lift from the books. The characters and the actors also seem good. I liked the focus on plot development rather than spectacle. Music is always good but I do hope we get more unique tracks moving forward rather than just rehashing the old score. I loved the costume and set design and am glad that we have more diversity in looks because at a certain point it felt like GoT just wanted a character to wear just one set of clothes.

I'm apprehensive about the decision to make the Long Night prophecy important to the story. On one hand, it makes sense that there were multiple Targaryens who believed that was their destiny (Rhaegar for example) and it is a very important part of ASOIAF. On the other hand that shit was so trash when it actually happened that forgetting that it was a thing might be for the better.

Most importantly I liked the sense of familiarity it gave back to me. I remember watching Season 8 of GoT and feeling that it wasn't even the same show anymore. But HotD felt very familiar with what I associate with GoT. Ten minutes in and I felt nostalgic. And I think that is something that was imperative to winning back fans who fell out of love with the series. Remind us why we fell in love with GoT in the first place.","season 8"
"381","I’m not even a fan of GoT and the top comments basically amounting to “season 8 wasn’t *that* big of a disaster, go and watch Thrones on HBO! It’s worth it!”","season 8"
"382","I don't feel the same way, but I understand why you'd feel that way.

The main reason why I don't feel that way is that, tbh, in my opinion the show started going downhill in season 5 and kept slowly going downhill for season 6, 7 and 8. So by the time season 8 rolled around I was already pretty emotionally disconnected from it all and wasn't expecting anything good.

I prefer to see seasons 1-4 as the REAL show and the canon show and think of 5-8 as some fan fiction that never happened. That allows me to enjoy seasons 1-4 for what they are, I think. Because I consider that the full TV story.","season 8"
