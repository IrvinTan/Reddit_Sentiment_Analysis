"3","I hear you, and I’m sure the upboats make you feel vindicated but I will try to put it simply. 

Nothing is perfect. The first few seasons had their issues. They were still historic in the quality and depth of characters and storytelling. 

Where the first few seasons issues were minor, the final season’s issues were glaring. Instead of beating a dead horse with all the details I will once again refer you to the limitless amount of information already available on this topic.

I mean, there’s a reason GRRM started expressing serious concerns by Season 5, and by season 7 he was flying out to meet the HBO boss *monthly*.  Just to beg him to right the veering ship. 

If you genuinely think this is a case of all of us, including the ingenious mind of GRRM that created the damn universe in the first place, having inherent bias for the first seasons while putting the final season under unnecessary scrutiny… Well, we simply have fundamental disagreements of what makes exceptional television. 

Because the first 4 seasons, despite their flaws, were *exceptional.* I **do not** feel under any circumstances the final season can be seen as exceptional, unless one simply does not have a discerning bone in their body when it comes to what makes exceptional television. Honestly, some people are just enjoying the ride and don’t need to play critic. That’s cool. 

But it is the opinion of myself and millions of other fans, critics, etc that the final season was lackluster at best, and a downright travesty at worst.","season 5"
"4","I just get annoyed, sure it's cool, but I only remember how GoT was botched after season 4. I saw that during the Dorne arc during season 5, sure there was some cool stuff but that couldn't make up for it. Every season I kept thinking that was bad but surely it can't get worse than that, but it always did, just worse and worse. D&amp;D will forever be a study on how to completely and entirely fuck up what could have been one of the all-time greatest shows.","season 5"
"5","Core books of A Song of Ice and Fire series:

1. _A Game of Thrones_ corresponds to Season 1
2. _A Clash of Kings_ corresponds to Season 2
3. _A Storm of Swords_ corresponds to Seasons 3-4
4. _A Feast for Crows_ some plotlines used from Season 5+
5. _A Dance with Dragons_ ditto
6. _The Winds of Winter_, unfinished, material from some sample chapters used in Season 6
7. _A Dream of Spring_, title of what's supposed to be the final novel, someday

Prequel novellas in “Dunk &amp; Egg” timeline, about a century before ASOIAF, collected in _A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms_. These were originally published as non-spoilery jumping-on points for new readers between the early novels, and you can read them whenever you like. Some D&amp;E elements are referenced in the later novels as Easter eggs (and may also be clues towards/set up important historical stuff), especially in AFFC onwards:

1. “The Hedge Knight”, originally in _Legends_ anthology edited by Robert Silverberg, reprinted with some commentary by GRRM in his _Dreamsongs: A RRetrospective_ short story collection
2. “The Sworn Sword”, originally in _Legends II_ anthology
3. “The Mystery Knight”, originally in _Warriors_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois

Prequel fake history books, written in the style of a maester recounting and commenting upon past events:

1. _Fire &amp; Blood_, covering approximately half the time since the Targaryen Conquest 300 years before ASOIAF. Parts of this have previously appearead as the following novellas which were originally published in anthologies (mostly minor changes, “The Princess and the Queen” is the most expanded). NB: this starts straight at the Conquest and doesn't cover the situation leading up to it, which you'd have to get from TWOIAF if you're interested:

	a. “Sons of the Dragon” with Aegon the Conqueror's heirs, originally in _The Book of Swords_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois  
	b. “The Princess and the Queen”, rivalry of Rhaenyra and Alicent which will be part of House of the Dragon show, originally in _Dangerous Women_ anthology  
	c. “The Rogue Prince”, some events of TPATQ focusing on Daemon Targaryen, originally in _Rogues_ anthology

Prequel fake history books that are tie-in supplements:

1. _The World of Ice and Fire_, heavily illustrated lorebook/artbook, with the first half giving a history from the earliest prehistorical times, then the Conquest and the reigns of all the Targaryen rulers up until just before Robert's Rebellion more than a decade before the start of ASOIAF. The back half gives regional histories for all Seven Kingdoms, plus the lands of Essos and beyond. Only parts of it are written by GRRM (as sidebars from “Maester Gyldayn”), the rest written up by his co-authors from his notes.  
  
  NB: there's a couple of spoilers for particular major events from AGOT through ASOS in the fake intro and the fake outro, so you may choose to skip reading those parts until you've finished those novels (and maybe also Dunk &amp; Egg since some of the history chapters give away the fates of certain guest characters), but otherwise pretty much everything else in it won't involve details of the main series storylines.
2. upcoming _The Rise of the Dragon_, again mostly done by GRRM's co-authors, basically a rewrite of parts of F&amp;B into a more encyclopedic style like TWOIAF, lavishly illustrated with new art

Other supplementary books:

- _The Lands of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in book of foldout maps showing all the regions in more detail and full colour, nice to have, but note necessary
- _A Feast of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in cookbook with recipes based on the series, foreword by GRRM
- _The Wit and Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister_, just quotes from the books, with a few cartoony illustrations, IMHO not worth it unless you find it in a bargain discount bin and are morbidly curious
- “A World of Ice and Fire” official tie-in app for Android &amp; iOS devices, done by the TWOIAF co-authors. Wiki-style mini-encyclopedia of characters and places throughout the books with illustrations taken from other official tie-ins, with a slider that can be set per-book (paid content) to avoid spoilers. Apparently has some trivia tidbits not found in TWOIAF and the official fansite's wiki, taken from GRRM's notes. The free section has the entirety of the entries for the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas, as well as several but not all of the TWOW sample chapters released so far (easiest way to read most of them, IMHO), and a few more sample chapters from TWOIAF, and sample maps from TLOAIF.

Not a tie-in, even though the back copy advertises it as such:

- “The Ice Dragon”, a novella set in an entirely different fantasy universe, but some of whose ideas were speculated to have been used in Season 7 and might be relevant to future novels, available reprinted in _Dreamsongs_ and in a standalone illustrated hardcover/ebook edition.
- you may also come across mention of “Blood of the Dragon”, “Path of the Dragon”, and “The Arms of the Kraken”. These are just novellas compiled from selected POV chapters from the ASOIAF novels, repackaged into a storyline following just the one character as a promo.

Bonus editions with extras:

AGOT through ASOS are currently available in rather nice The Illustrated Edition anniversary hardcovers with artwork depicting characters and events (there are also other licensed illustrated editions from specialty publishers with different art, but these are the more common and affordable ones from Penguin Random House &amp; HarperCollins Voyager).

And the entire series so far is also available in a very nice The Enhanced Edition for Mac/iOS devices from the Apple iTunes Store, which has handy features showing a map of where each character is at the start of their chapter (taken from _The Lands of Ice and Fire_ mapbook), a recap of what happened in the last, a character glossary recapping what happened to them in previous books, some artwork and sample passages read from the audiobooks, and some footnotes giving worldbuilding background details and trivia tidbits (mostly pulled from interview quotes and GRRM's notes given to his helpers).

All the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas are available in a graphic novel adaptation if you like comics, and so are AGOT and ACOK in collected editions (ASOS is apparently also being done, but currently unfinished).

Hope this helps!","season 5"
"6","Thats good that you enjoyed it. I started it around the end of season 5 when jon snow died, and holy shit the fandom and theories were just so interesting. I loved s6 even though many didnt, s7 was alright until the end and then s8. So many things wrong, and the YEARS of buildup and waiting for winter and then the night king immediately dies and...thats it. Sure you can say s8 is decent in terms of tv in general, but compared to the first half of the show it just doesnt even hit the same dimension. The worst part is the blatant character assassinations, and the Dany one isnt even as bad as others. Jon snow does absolutely nothing and his heritage doesnt matter at all, tyrion makes horrible decisions, Varys' death was so anticlimactic, Jamies arc was totally ruined, the night king was a joke, etc. I can go on and on, and honestly since the s8 finale I had no desire to ever watch it again, and I was a massive fan. But hey, if you liked it you liked it. I will never understand why but I cant take that away from you","season 5"
"7","&gt;Daenerys suddenly going mad and killing people when her whole thing is empowerment and freedom of the people.

Except Dany's ""whole thing"" is not empowerment and freedom of the people.. that was just an arc she had for a few seasons... from the middle of Season 3 to the end of Season 5... that's it. Maybe 25 episodes out of 70+. 

Seasons 1, 2, the start of 3, 7 and 8 are all about her conquest for the Iron Throne... the majority of the show. 

Sure, Dany deserves mad props for her actions in Slaver's Bay, but people need to stop pretending like that was her entire character, as it completely undermines/downplays her very clearly established Fire and Blood persona and personal desire for this grand political power. 

It seems clear that people tend to overblow the aspects about characters they admire (like Dany and Jaime) and seemingly handwave/overlook their negative aspects, despite being rather plainly displayed on-screen for all to see. 

&gt;Jamie joining Cerci and the two die by rocks falling when there was a prophecy that said she would die by her brother's hand (and though she always thought it would be Tyrion, the Kingslayer was being built to become the Queen slayer).

The Valonquar prophecy is not show canon though, sorry. Would have been interesting to see, for sure, but it seemed pretty clear they weren't going to go that route considering they made the effort to edit that portion of the prophecy out of the show.","season 5"
"8","Varys died in season 5 cause whoever that was in season 8 was a faceless man pretending to be Varys. The rest earned their deaths lol. Dany never killed innocent children. She literally locked up two of her dragons cause of one innocent child being roasted.","season 5"

"10","I really enjoyed Season 5. Was surprised people thought this.","season 5"
"11","Dany and Jamie scenes.

Some viewers sure love to whinge about how those character arcs ended, but seemingly tend to forget/are unaware that their actions/choices in the end absolutely have had the groundwork laid for them across their entire arc leading up to Season 8.

Some people, over time, seemingly placed these two characters on some pedestal where only some grand animated Disney resolution would suffice, but, on-screen, these characters are portrayed as gray characters capable of both great and terrible acts, often based on both great and terrible choices.

Dany so often shows this Fire and Blood persona throughout her arc (as her advisors constantly tell her to tone it down) and her relationship with *power* becomes an increasingly suspect one, as when she doesn't have it she curses those who abuse it, but then as she gains power seemingly abuses it herself. Her whole arc is a series of hypocritical words/acts mixed with this fiery persona building up to a boiling point as her world comes crashing down upon her during her time in Westeros.

Also, people love to claim that her ""entire story"" revolved around helping the innocent, but that wasn't really the case, as it was a temporary goal of hers from midway in Season 3 (she literally went to Slaver's Bay in order to specifically purchase fighting slaves) to the end of Season 5 (when she rides off on Drogon.) That's it... aside from one single episode in Season 6, so maybe 25 episodes out of 70+. It's a nice arc, and certainly helps show off one side to her character (that many fans latched onto) but hardly an ""entire story"" as tends to get parroted. She spends Seasons 1, 2, half of 3, 7 and 8 trying to win the Iron Throne for herself... clearly a majority of her on-screen time.

As for Jaime, he so clearly has this soft spot for Cersei and literal life-long bond with her that I'm surprised so many people were gobsmacked by his decision. He literally spends 7+ seasons doing anything/everything for her while not giving two fucks about anyone not named Lannister (or Brienne), but people seemingly are surprised that he went back to her simply because he slept with someone else once over 40+ years? And are surprised that he stated that he didn't care about people, despite it being pretty obvious for 7+ seasons that he didn't care about people. I mean, there are specific scenes when he is with Cersei when he literally states that he doesn't care about anyone else, but somehow people think their own personal head canon/interpretation of the bath scene magically supercedes what he literally states on-screen about the commonfolk.

I honestly believe if you review these two characters with an open mind and fresh eyes, that Season 8 is not ""as bad"" as many people claim. Sure, the last seasons will always be a bit rough, but I think having a unbiased understanding of these two characters will help anyone understand how these two arcs end by shedding a neutral light on how these characters got to this point.","season 5"
"12","Season 5 is what I point to when people want to blame GRRM not finishing the books for the show going downhill. No, Dumb and Dumber either radically altered or ignored 90% of AFFC and ADWD, books that were already published, and Season 5 wound up a disgrace as a result. Dumb and Dumber would've fucked up the series even if all the books were done.","season 5"

Cersei was even white washed on the show, she was a misogynist and a sadist in the books. Catelyn was clearly more than just a mother who loved her children. Although there is nothing wrong with just being a good mother, post modern feminists actually think it's a weakness to just be a good wife and mother who will do anything for their family. Go check out how many neglectful and narcissistic mothers have ruined their children's lives in the real world","season 5"

"17","Oh yeah I’m definitely not excusing season 5’s poor excuse of a Dorne subplot. Imo the super easy solution would have been to have Doran give his fire and blood speech at the end of the season and reveal that he’s been in kahoots with Varys all along to join forces with Daenerys once she invades. Maybe even have a small storyline in season 7/8 about Dany choosing between Trystane and Jon if they wanted that. 

Clearly it’s not as good as book material, but it at least resembles the Dornish storyline and it’s insane to me that they decided to trash it entirely.","season 5"

"20","&gt;My point is that my quotes are just as viable as yours, and arguably more so since she actually acted on these, she did free the slaves, she chained up her dragons, and she only made the city-destroying threats for betrayal such as when the master broke a promise and attacked, or when Yunki and Astapor were retaken by them.

OK, so when a woman going to the cops claiming that a man has threatened to rape/murder her multiple times, you're saying the cops are correct in siding with the man because he hasn't actually done the act he's threatened yet? Because his actions are more viable than his threats simply because he hasn't acted on the threats yet? As long as he volunteers at a soup kitchen and works for a non-profit organization, his actions automatically outweigh any and all vicious threats?  

That's your stance here? That because the willingness/capacity for a terrible act hasn't yet been acted upon, therefore it doesn't hold weight? 

Seems rather dismissive and short-sighted of a stance to take, considering how often the cops hand-wave the threats for the very reasons you cite, and that women, almost inevitably, end up harmed or killed. 

You absolutely can not pretend that she has not shown a capacity/willingness for genocide, or downplay it because it hasn't happened *yet*. 

It's like watching a tea kettle under growing pressure/heat and claiming it will never boil because it hasn't boiled *yet*... that's a fallacy. 

&gt;\&gt; Here is the thing, I am not saying Danny would never kill someone...

Not sure if you honestly missed the point or this is a cheap attempt at moving the goalposts, but replace ""murder"" with ""genocide"" and that's the point... it's just that it's not like people in the real world have access to giant dragons where they can easily raze cities (as opposed to murder, which is 'easily available'.)

Dany clearly showed a capacity/willingness to raze thousands of people, innocents and all, from her own mouth, on-screen, multiple times.  

She clearly is capable of the very act you claim she is not, and no amount of saving slaves magically undoes that, sorry. 

*The good does not wash out the bad.* 

&gt;\&gt; At least then I can see the still water, then some bubbles forming at the bottom, every once in a while rising to the top until it does finally reach said boiling point and I can finally put the pasta in.

And plenty of viewers saw and pointed out those very bubbles you claim never existed. Problem is that you weren't looking into the pot to see those signs while other people were checking for those very bubbles because they were concerned by all the red flags across her storyline.

Heck, characters on-screen literally point out the bubbles. Tyrion and Varys clearly take time out of a busy final seasons to make literal comparisons to her father, or point out how eager she is to raze King's Landing, or isn't listening to reason... those bubbles *absolutely exist on-screen*... it's up to the viewer to take a look into the pot. 

I mean, it's like you're in the living room, then complaining you can't see the bubbles forming in the bottom of the pot, while others standing by the stove are pointing them out. I mean, plenty of people/writers/podcasts pointed out the case for Mad Queen Dany even before S8E5 aired... because they saw the bubbles. 

&gt;\&gt; Now I can agree, she has gone through a lot, I think they portrayed these tragic events poorly and it comes off more that she will kill everyone because Jon wouldn't fuck her rather than the grief of losing her dragon and Misandi...

I think she hoped her and Jon could rule together, but he clearly dismissed that theory and that seemed to be a final straw for her. Believe it has more to do with Jon being the rightful heir and her claim is not the ""rightful one"" and they aren not able to rule together more than ""Jon wouldn't fuck her.""

&gt;\&gt; but my argument would be why is Danny so much weaker than everyone else?

Weaker? Nonsense... it's about Fire and Blood and upbrinings. 

She so obviously has the *Blood of the Dragon* in her, and that so obviously affects that family, including who raised her (Viserys.)

She has a fucked up life, raised by Viserys, affected by this Fire and Blood. Sold as a child bride, raped, etc. 

Starks grown up with a stable life, in Winterfell, with awesome parents. 

It's not hard to see a huge difference in their upbrinings, which would obviously affect their mental issues. 

&gt;\&gt; Idk about that, with how much of a mess season 5-7 were, I feel like the dots you're saying are there to connect are just 6 points that make you draw a pointy mountain and the book tells you it's a castle.

Look, tons of people pointed out the very real possibility of Mad Queen Dany long before S8E5 aired, so clearly there are dots that form that image. 

If you didn't see, or refuse to see it, that's on you, but that's like claiming Waldo isn't in a spread of Where's Waldo simply because you didn't see it then, and refuse to see it now. 

&gt;\&gt; I will admit that those reasons were part of it, yet the key component that can hold up to scrutiny is his want to save the people. 

There's absolutely nothing to back this fabricated theory of your though... like at all. 

&gt;For example, he never had a great relationship with his father and it only got worse when he joined the KG.

And do you think Jaime had a 'great relationship' with the people of King's Landing?! 

Also, even if his relationship with his father wasn't perfect doesn't mean he wouldn't try to save him over the Mad King. 

&gt;\&gt; Protecting the smallfolk is what holds up best under scrutiny when you look to his actions even after the events before we see much development with him, stepping in to save Brienne from getting raped, jumping into a bear pit to save her, armoring her and arming her to go find and save Sansa.

Lol, except nothing you state actually support your baseless theory about **him caring about the commonfolk.**   


&gt;\&gt; *stepping in to save* ***Brienne*** *from getting raped, jumping into a bear pit to save* ***her****, armoring* ***her*** *and arming her to go find and save Sansa.*

OK, all of these things revolve around **a single person who is the epitome of honor** in his eyes... HONOR. 

He develops a soft spot for Brienne because of **his troubled relationship with honor.**

Him helping her is about honor... not some empathy for the common folk. 

She obviously is not ""common folk"" (she is literally a knight from a prominent family, like him), so I've no clue why you think his soft spot for another knight magically translates into his empathy towards commonfolk... it's completely nonsensical to equate the two. 

PS - Also pawning off his oath by throwing money at Brienne is not really as honorable as people want to pretend. If you promised to take your kids to the beach, you don't get credit for doing so by giving gas money to your neighbors (who were already planning on going) and having them take them instead so you can get your rocks off at home. 

Stopping her from getting raped and jumping into the bear pit... incredibly selfless and he deserves mad props for that, absolutely. But arming someone else so he doesn't have to deal with the Stark girls so he can remain a Lannister lap dog is just throwing money at something he didn't want to do, so he can remain by Cersei's side (or do her bidding.)","season 5"
"21","Typically if there's a series out there that has a shitty ending for whatever reason I'll watch up to that point then drop it.

I'm currently watching GoT for the first time (up to S3 E10) I'm planning on watching every episode then from the gist of things then any future rewatches will end when I reach the point where I think it's not either worth it, or don't want to see the characters end up a certain way.  

I haven't read the books, and I know by Season 5 they took things in their own direction, so since it's not technically the works of G.R.R.M couldn't the events of what happened up to that point be ignored as glorified fanfic?

Tyrion becomes an idiot, Bran is just a robot that ends up taking over, Varys becomes powerless, I could go on but you get my point.","season 5"
"23","\*Cries as I accidentally deleted my response.\* Ok, one more time.  


&gt;Lol, just because a line is spoken doesn't magically make it some ironclad truth... wild that 8 seasons of Game of Thrones hasn't taught you that.  
&gt;  
&gt;I mean, you seemingly claim a character's word is ironclad and cherry-pick some quote as if it's gospel, but when I point out that she, multiple times STATED ON-SCREEN she going to kill thousands upon thousands of innocents because she wanted to, that doesn't count in your eyes? Only the quotes you cherry pick matter or count as canon or can be construed as fact? Any quotes that disprove your quotes magically don't count because Dany reasons?  
&gt;  
&gt;Talk about bad faith discussion.  


I got plenty of more, ""I am not my father."" ""I am not here to be queen of the Ashes."" ""Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city."" ""I don't want another child's bones dropped at my feet."" ""I am a queen, not a butcher.""   


And how am I cherry-picking? My point wasn't ""This is everything Danny has ever said this proves my point and your quote was fabricated."" That would be ridiculous.  


You brought up the scene where she threatens to burn all the wise masters cities while watching them attack her city and trying to burn it down. My point is that my quotes are just as viable as yours, and arguably more so since she actually acted on these, she did free the slaves, she chained up her dragons, and she only made the city-destroying threats for betrayal such as when the master broke a promise and attacked, or when Yunki and Astapor were retaken by them. The people of Kingslanding have not done anything of the sort and even still despite the masters being the worse and honestly even I would have defended her if she whipped them out she didn't likely not just for moral reasons but practicality as well as listening to Tyrion got her the ships she needed to sail to Westeros and abandon Mereen, which is an issue itself but I am trying to focus on season 8 and the shit stain that it is. 

&gt;I mean, if in one scene a character says they would never kill someone, then in multiple other scenes they clearly state they would kill someone, can you honestly defend the theory that they would never kill someone?  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course not.  


Here is the thing, I am not saying Danny would never kill someone, hell she smothered her own husband, she burned hundred of soldiers to death, no killing isn't my issue, good character like Jon have killed people, and it was much more hands on, but does that mean I can picture him ordering his men to sack and burn villages, cutting the throats of the smallfolk or turning them to ash on a Dragon? Hell no, and hey you know what, it would make more sense for Jon to do this than Danny because Jon actually has killed a kid with his own hands.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's not that complex... she's like a tea kettle. Over time the pressure builds and builds until that pressure literally reaches a boiling point. We know she has this Fire and Blood persona bubbling up underneath, Season 8 completely implodes her entire world, her psyche is shot and that Fire and Blood persona is no longer 'contained', and she reaches this emotional climax where that Fire and Blood persona hits a violent boiling point.  


You do know that by comparisons achieving boiling water takes longer then Danny falling into madness. At least then I can see the still water, then some bubbles forming at the bottom, every once in a while rising to the top until it does finally reach said boiling point and I can finally put the pasta in.   


Now I can agree, she has gone through a lot, I think they portrayed these tragic events poorly and it comes off more that she will kill everyone because Jon wouldn't fuck her rather than the grief of losing her dragon and Misandi, but my argument would be why is Danny so much weaker than everyone else?  


Jon, Sansa, and Arya have arguably gone through just as hard of times if not worse then Danny and are still somewhat mentally sound, the most fucked up being Arya but even she saw what Danny did and smartly said ""I no a killer when I see one."" WOW THANKS ARYA WE NEVER WOULD HAVE FIGURED THAT OUT!!! Shit getting of topic again.  


But if that doesn't work for you since they are different characters then lets just look at the shit that Danny when through season, her child turned into a stillborn and her husband a vegetable by a women who she tried to save, her kindness and trust resulting in losing two things very important to her. Dare I say that scene has far more justification for her to go mad but she keeps to her more kind-hearted nature and goes on her mission to free the slaves. 

&gt;Sure, I think the show would have benefitted from more episodes to help with some pacing issues, absolutely.. but there's enough 'dots' to connect to see the picture... even if the picture isn't as detailed as it probably could have been.  


Idk about that, with how much of a mess season 5-7 were, I feel like the dots you're saying are there to connect are just 6 points that make you draw a pointy mountain and the book tells you it's a castle. 

&gt;\&gt; for it saved many of the innocents in kingslanding, otherwise why do it?  
&gt;  
&gt;Wait... are you serious?  
&gt;  
&gt;How about to save his father? To save Lannister forces? To save himself? TO help the Lannisters gain power? Because he fucking hates Aerys and what he did to people both behind closed doors and in public?  
&gt;  
&gt;If you honestly believe the only benefit for him to kill the Mad King was solely to help the commoners, you desperately need to revisit the actual story, because  ALL THE REASONS make sense for why Jaime did what he did... not just the single one you've cherry-picked and pretend is some sole reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;I mean, he literally mentions 'father' first in the bath scene question he proposes to Brienne... clearly there is more than a single reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again, you're cherry-picking here and pretending like nothing else exists surrounding the issue... bad faith.  


I will admit that those reasons were part of it, yet the key component that can hold up to scrutiny is his want to save the people. For example, he never had a great relationship with his father and it only got worse when he joined the KG.  
Saving the Lannister forces would coincide with saving the people, after all if he dose not care about the small folk why would he care about his fathers soldiers? Not to mention he actually fights against them to defend the red keep which would likely be to defend what smallfolk were able to retreat into the castle. And of course he hated Aerys we don't often kill people we like, unless your Danny, or Jon, or Tyrion, oh shit Jamie killed his cousin (I got my issues with that scene as well) so maybe he didn't hate Aryes.   


And as far as saving himself there were plenty of moments he could have just gotten away without risking his life, even in a way so that his ""honor"" would be intact much like Baristan. Running away and coming back after saying he fought hard and barely survived the wildfire eruption.   
Protecting the smallfolk is what holds up best under scrutiny when you look to his actions even after the events before we see much development with him, stepping in to save Brienne from getting raped, jumping into a bear pit to save her, armoring her and arming her to go find and save Sansa.","season 5"
"24","tbf it was going awful since season 5 at least,  they just got away with it cause it wasnt so obvious","season 5"
"25","Hord up, hord up. I guess you can thank grrm for the source material and the books of course, but the show is all about DD for all the good and bad. Actually season 6 is where the source material is no more; from what I’ve read, season 5 is the last season based on the events of the books. However season 6 is a stand alone miracle season. No spoilers, but it’s one of the best seasons, and just think about what you’ve seen so far for yet another season topping prior ones.","season 5"
"26","i know, which is why i love season 5","season 5"
"27","Short answer ? Season 5. They fucked up Dany’s  story with how they wrote Meereen.","season 5"
"28","Except they choose to ignore two of the books he wrote and go basically an entirely different direction for season 5.","season 5"
"29","Seasons 3 &amp; 4 are still close to the books. Starting at season 5, the gap gets wider and wider and the last two seasons is completely free style. You can feel it in the narrative : it becomes less coherent with sometimes huge plot holes. The serie also becomes more action-oriented with big battlefields... That sometimes feels weird, because badly designed.

To sum up, half of the serie is close to the books, the other half is like filler manga. It's nice and all, but weird and incoherent compared to the beginning.","season 5"
"30","First off, might want to dispel the notion that her entire identity was about freeing slaves and realize that literally most of her screentime was spent pursuing power for herself. 

Seasons 1, 2, and the beginning of 3? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. Seasons 7 and 8? All about conquering the Iron Throne for herself. So 4.5 seasons of conquering versus less than 3 about freeing slaves (back half of Season 3, Season 4, Season 5, one episode in Season 6.. the clear minority.)

Her time in Slaver's Bay was a single arc, not some 'whole' identity. 

That said, I think a fresh and unbiased rewatch always helps paint a clearer picture of the issue. 

Season 8 completely implodes her world around her. If you see her psyche as a Jenga tower, it's easy to see how it becomes increasingly unstable throughout the final season until it is this unstable, teetering structure that finally topples over in an emotional moment. 

Her support structure crumbles (deaths, betrayals), her hopes and dreams and beliefs shattered (Jon's heritage reveal, she's not the Chosen One, Westeros doesn't love her) and her promising relationships all sour (killed, betrayed, Jon's romantic relationship ends.)

Keep in mind she's a young adult with a fucked-up upbringing (sold, raped, etc) with a Fire and Blood persona and family history of mental issues. Her entire world comes crashing down on her in a short amount of time, and this is a person who, has literally stated from her own mouth multiple times previously that she is capable/willing to raze entire cities if she feels the ends justify the means. 

She clearly states, in the latter episodes an increasingly deteriorated mental state, that she now sees the people of King's Landing as 'supporting' Cersei (ie, enemies) and that she has decided to ""Rule by Fear.""

Then, once she sees the Red Keep, that Jenga tower that's been teetering on a single piece because of all the other pieces that once held it in place are missing, finally topples over, and that Fire and Blood persona that's been bubbling up all this time is finally unleashed in full force. 

Wish we could have gleaned more context from the scene if we could have seen her as she razed part of King's Landing, but unfortunately we didn't get to see her again until the aftermath in the next episode.","season 5"
"31","In hindsight the ending of GoT isn't THAT bad. Disappointing? Underwhelming? Poorly-executed? Absolutely. But upon an analysis of the characters, their motives and their experiences most of the resolution of the series largely makes sense. It is in all likelihood the general resolution that GRRM had planned, and the backlash is probably another in a long list of reasons he will never finish the books.

There were hints at Dany's mad queen side throughout the series. But instead of a gradual decline, the show just kind of flips a switch, which is not satisfying at all. It's like as if in Breaking Bad Walter White goes from Pilot episode HS chemistry teacher to Season 5 prison massacre ruthlessness in the span of one or two episodes. Just showing a budding jealousy of Jon, a betrayal by Varys and the sudden deaths of two of her dragons over the span of a few episodes wasn't enough after, like you said, seasons of portraying a benevolent liberator.","season 5"
"32","The burning of Shireen, the daughter of Stannis in season 5","season 5"
"33","Season 5 was two books in one season, what do you mean ran out of books after S4","season 5"
"34","everything up since season 5 end and Jon Snow's death is hbo wirten, in the book stannis is still alive, dany is still in essos, tyrion hasn't met her yet etc 

&amp;#x200B;

and i think the jon snow show and arya is based on nothing but greed","season 5"
"35","I don't feel the same way, but I understand why you'd feel that way.

The main reason why I don't feel that way is that, tbh, in my opinion the show started going downhill in season 5 and kept slowly going downhill for season 6, 7 and 8. So by the time season 8 rolled around I was already pretty emotionally disconnected from it all and wasn't expecting anything good.

I prefer to see seasons 1-4 as the REAL show and the canon show and think of 5-8 as some fan fiction that never happened. That allows me to enjoy seasons 1-4 for what they are, I think. Because I consider that the full TV story.","season 5"
