"1","&gt;‚ÄúA monster has taken our home and our brother, we have to get them back.‚Äù They weren‚Äôt seeking power.

Yes they were.

*JON SNOW: We can‚Äôt defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men.*

&gt;John was saying that THEIR treason has already been punished, because they were dead and the issue was moot.

Which suggests Jon would have executed them if they hadn't died.

&gt;I don‚Äôt see how that proves Arya wrong?

Sansa you mean? She ostensibly\* thought that placating Robbet Glover would keep him on Jon's side. It didn't. Letting people get away with open disrespect is a bad idea when you're at the head of dictatorship.

\*I don't know what she was supposed to be thinking in the final version, but the outline for season 7 has Sansa going along with what Robbet Glover said because [she was trying to steal Jon's position](https://imgur.com/a/hdV4ByK).

&gt;Literally any other punishment, put in a dungeon,

Did you notice that no one was sentenced to prison during the show? The only times we saw the dungeons was when someone was being tortured, waiting for trial, or waiting for their execution. No one was sentenced to a prison term because that's not a thing in that world. You have to have a certain amount of excess to think keeping people alive in cages is prudent thing to do. Jon wasn't going commit to feeding a bunch of traitors through winter.

&gt;kept as a servant prisoner like Osha,

Kept as a slave you mean? Slavery is illegal in Westeros. Keeping warriors that refuse to kneel as slaves is also a good way to get yourself murdered.

&gt;Yes I know he refused it, that‚Äôs not the point, the point is Tyrion offered it because he knew execution was wrong.

Tyrion oversaw the execution of two slavers at the end of season 6. Not to mention the fact that he murdered his father and ex girlfriend.","season 7"

The sex scene between Jaime and Cersei in the Sept was written, acted and shot as consensual but the editing made it a rape scene.   
Melisandre didn't appear old in the bath when she doesn't wear her glamour. 
The whole episode on the frozen lake in season 7...
It's a show, they can make mistakes or stupid things for a good shot, to create tension / a cliffhanger. 
They wanted to show the Others and to end on a cliffanger, they put a favorite and he survived because he still have stuff to do (Gilly) and not because the Others have a depper, secret motivation.","season 7"
"8","I hear you, and I‚Äôm sure the upboats make you feel vindicated but I will try to put it simply. 

Nothing is perfect. The first few seasons had their issues. They were still historic in the quality and depth of characters and storytelling. 

Where the first few seasons issues were minor, the final season‚Äôs issues were glaring. Instead of beating a dead horse with all the details I will once again refer you to the limitless amount of information already available on this topic.

I mean, there‚Äôs a reason GRRM started expressing serious concerns by Season 5, and by season 7 he was flying out to meet the HBO boss *monthly*.  Just to beg him to right the veering ship. 

If you genuinely think this is a case of all of us, including the ingenious mind of GRRM that created the damn universe in the first place, having inherent bias for the first seasons while putting the final season under unnecessary scrutiny‚Ä¶ Well, we simply have fundamental disagreements of what makes exceptional television. 

Because the first 4 seasons, despite their flaws, were *exceptional.* I **do not** feel under any circumstances the final season can be seen as exceptional, unless one simply does not have a discerning bone in their body when it comes to what makes exceptional television. Honestly, some people are just enjoying the ride and don‚Äôt need to play critic. That‚Äôs cool. 

But it is the opinion of myself and millions of other fans, critics, etc that the final season was lackluster at best, and a downright travesty at worst.","season 7"

"10","Core books of A Song of Ice and Fire series:

1. _A Game of Thrones_ corresponds to Season 1
2. _A Clash of Kings_ corresponds to Season 2
3. _A Storm of Swords_ corresponds to Seasons 3-4
4. _A Feast for Crows_ some plotlines used from Season 5+
5. _A Dance with Dragons_ ditto
6. _The Winds of Winter_, unfinished, material from some sample chapters used in Season 6
7. _A Dream of Spring_, title of what's supposed to be the final novel, someday

Prequel novellas in ‚ÄúDunk &amp; Egg‚Äù timeline, about a century before ASOIAF, collected in _A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms_. These were originally published as non-spoilery jumping-on points for new readers between the early novels, and you can read them whenever you like. Some D&amp;E elements are referenced in the later novels as Easter eggs (and may also be clues towards/set up important historical stuff), especially in AFFC onwards:

1. ‚ÄúThe Hedge Knight‚Äù, originally in _Legends_ anthology edited by Robert Silverberg, reprinted with some commentary by GRRM in his _Dreamsongs: A RRetrospective_ short story collection
2. ‚ÄúThe Sworn Sword‚Äù, originally in _Legends II_ anthology
3. ‚ÄúThe Mystery Knight‚Äù, originally in _Warriors_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois

Prequel fake history books, written in the style of a maester recounting and commenting upon past events:

1. _Fire &amp; Blood_, covering approximately half the time since the Targaryen Conquest 300 years before ASOIAF. Parts of this have previously appearead as the following novellas which were originally published in anthologies (mostly minor changes, ‚ÄúThe Princess and the Queen‚Äù is the most expanded). NB: this starts straight at the Conquest and doesn't cover the situation leading up to it, which you'd have to get from TWOIAF if you're interested:

	a. ‚ÄúSons of the Dragon‚Äù with Aegon the Conqueror's heirs, originally in _The Book of Swords_ anthology co-edited by GRRM and Gardner Dozois  
	b. ‚ÄúThe Princess and the Queen‚Äù, rivalry of Rhaenyra and Alicent which will be part of House of the Dragon show, originally in _Dangerous Women_ anthology  
	c. ‚ÄúThe Rogue Prince‚Äù, some events of TPATQ focusing on Daemon Targaryen, originally in _Rogues_ anthology

Prequel fake history books that are tie-in supplements:

1. _The World of Ice and Fire_, heavily illustrated lorebook/artbook, with the first half giving a history from the earliest prehistorical times, then the Conquest and the reigns of all the Targaryen rulers up until just before Robert's Rebellion more than a decade before the start of ASOIAF. The back half gives regional histories for all Seven Kingdoms, plus the lands of Essos and beyond. Only parts of it are written by GRRM (as sidebars from ‚ÄúMaester Gyldayn‚Äù), the rest written up by his co-authors from his notes.  
  
  NB: there's a couple of spoilers for particular major events from AGOT through ASOS in the fake intro and the fake outro, so you may choose to skip reading those parts until you've finished those novels (and maybe also Dunk &amp; Egg since some of the history chapters give away the fates of certain guest characters), but otherwise pretty much everything else in it won't involve details of the main series storylines.
2. upcoming _The Rise of the Dragon_, again mostly done by GRRM's co-authors, basically a rewrite of parts of F&amp;B into a more encyclopedic style like TWOIAF, lavishly illustrated with new art

Other supplementary books:

- _The Lands of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in book of foldout maps showing all the regions in more detail and full colour, nice to have, but note necessary
- _A Feast of Ice and Fire_, official tie-in cookbook with recipes based on the series, foreword by GRRM
- _The Wit and Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister_, just quotes from the books, with a few cartoony illustrations, IMHO not worth it unless you find it in a bargain discount bin and are morbidly curious
- ‚ÄúA World of Ice and Fire‚Äù official tie-in app for Android &amp; iOS devices, done by the TWOIAF co-authors. Wiki-style mini-encyclopedia of characters and places throughout the books with illustrations taken from other official tie-ins, with a slider that can be set per-book (paid content) to avoid spoilers. Apparently has some trivia tidbits not found in TWOIAF and the official fansite's wiki, taken from GRRM's notes. The free section has the entirety of the entries for the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas, as well as several but not all of the TWOW sample chapters released so far (easiest way to read most of them, IMHO), and a few more sample chapters from TWOIAF, and sample maps from TLOAIF.

Not a tie-in, even though the back copy advertises it as such:

- ‚ÄúThe Ice Dragon‚Äù, a novella set in an entirely different fantasy universe, but some of whose ideas were speculated to have been used in Season 7 and might be relevant to future novels, available reprinted in _Dreamsongs_ and in a standalone illustrated hardcover/ebook edition.
- you may also come across mention of ‚ÄúBlood of the Dragon‚Äù, ‚ÄúPath of the Dragon‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThe Arms of the Kraken‚Äù. These are just novellas compiled from selected POV chapters from the ASOIAF novels, repackaged into a storyline following just the one character as a promo.

Bonus editions with extras:

AGOT through ASOS are currently available in rather nice The Illustrated Edition anniversary hardcovers with artwork depicting characters and events (there are also other licensed illustrated editions from specialty publishers with different art, but these are the more common and affordable ones from Penguin Random House &amp; HarperCollins Voyager).

And the entire series so far is also available in a very nice The Enhanced Edition for Mac/iOS devices from the Apple iTunes Store, which has handy features showing a map of where each character is at the start of their chapter (taken from _The Lands of Ice and Fire_ mapbook), a recap of what happened in the last, a character glossary recapping what happened to them in previous books, some artwork and sample passages read from the audiobooks, and some footnotes giving worldbuilding background details and trivia tidbits (mostly pulled from interview quotes and GRRM's notes given to his helpers).

All the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas are available in a graphic novel adaptation if you like comics, and so are AGOT and ACOK in collected editions (ASOS is apparently also being done, but currently unfinished).

Hope this helps!","season 7"
"11","yes I loved season 6 and season 7 was average but when I say ‚Äúunhappy endings‚Äù I mean good characters dying and not getting what they deserve or character‚Äôs storyline‚Äôs kind of being ruined because of certain events.","season 7"
"12","&gt;No, I listed one complaint about the equipment they should‚Äôve used IN the attack, and one complaint about a dragon not being used. 

Those are issues with how they led the defense of Winterfell. I don't know why you're trying to dispute that. It's OK to criticize bad writing. 

&gt;That gif of them throwing themselves off a cliff only tells Jon that they don‚Äôt rest or tire, 

It also shows that the zombie are not afraid of being injured. Humans having a fear of being trampled by 1000+ pound animals is the main reason cavalry charges work. Jon would know that sending cavalry straight into a wall of zombies wouldn't work. 

&gt;The amount in which the dead were grouped together was NOT shown in any previous episode of the series at any point

Dany estimated that she saw 100k zombies in season 7. They would have added more on their way to Winterfell. Jon would have known that 100k+ zombies attacking one castle would be a cluster fuck.","season 7"
"13","I was angry at first for awhile but then I just kinda stopped caring and now its just disappointment more than anything. To me it was watching all the theories for what couldve been and where the story was going, but the reason people were so angry was the insane amount of hype that was built through the story itself and marketing, let alone the fact we had to wait a year and a half between season 7 and 8 and then we only got 6 episodes for events that shouldve lasted 2 or 3 entire seasons at least.

People started to see flaws in s6 but to me it was a little nitpicky, like when characters started teleporting around and more plot armor it didnt really bother me too much. But I agree the last 2 episodes in s6 are some of the best in television, which made the hype for season 7 and 8 that much greater, and ultimately even more disappointing. Its interesting to see the perspective of someone watching it now though vs a couple years ago because you arent as emotionally attached to it vs the fans that watched it weekly as it came out. Thats why there was so much anger at the time.","season 7"

"23","Oh yeah I‚Äôm definitely not excusing season 5‚Äôs poor excuse of a Dorne subplot. Imo the super easy solution would have been to have Doran give his fire and blood speech at the end of the season and reveal that he‚Äôs been in kahoots with Varys all along to join forces with Daenerys once she invades. Maybe even have a small storyline in season 7/8 about Dany choosing between Trystane and Jon if they wanted that. 

Clearly it‚Äôs not as good as book material, but it at least resembles the Dornish storyline and it‚Äôs insane to me that they decided to trash it entirely.","season 7"
"24","This is why Ive chosen to never watch season 7 and remain in blissful ignorance instead. I know S7 was bad, but will never have to know EXACTLY how bad.

Edit: I meant season 8 lmao.","season 7"
"25","&gt;Why should she? Now she's on home turf surrounded by people who support her. Why not take the gloves off.

The people didn't support Sansa. Jon was their leader. At best, any potential rebellion against Dany would split the North's forces between them.

For the sake of argument, let's say everyone in The North backed Sansa. Jon said they had ""less than 10k men"" in season 7. I don't know why they would side with Sansa in this situation, but add in the Vale forces and they would have had 12k. Dany had at least 50k. And two dragons. You don't see how Sansa ""taking the gloves off"" with Dany would be a bad idea?","season 7"
"26","It's simple... because she is the most hypocritical character portrayed within the show.

Just look at the examples:

When a captive of the Dothraki kills a Khal, she sees them as wrong and executes them for their actions... but later she herself, when captured by the Dothraki decides to kill the Khals.

She executes Mossador for taking matters into his own hands for killing a slaver outside of ""court"", but later after Selmy is killed has zero problems just executing a slaver outside of ""court"", regardless of innocence/guilt even.

Complains about being forced to marry for political gain... then forces a wrongfully imprisoned prisoner to marry her for her own political gain when it suits her agenda.

Is upset in Astapor that people are inhumanely executing for refusing to serve... later executes people who refuse to serve her in Westeros.

When she believes she has the rightful claim to the throne it is all important and she expects everyone to literally bow before her and hand her ships just because of her title... when it is discovered Jon is the rightful heir suddenly the ""rightful heir"" tag is completely meaningless in regards to who should sit on the Iron Throne and she still wants the throne for herself anyways.

Claims rulers in Westeros are corrupt/evil for what they do, then she does the exact same nonsense when she's in power... threatening Jon in regards to bending the knee , executing Tarleys for refusing to kneel, subjugating POWs through fear, etc.

I do think there's a very clear shift in her from Seasons 3 to Season 7. As you stated, in Season 3 she has people follow her because they believe in her message because her message is a just one, but in Season 7 she uses fear and power to subjugate people to follow her, like the Crown POWs and Jon

Season 3: allows the people she's freed to choose their own path.

Season 7: subjugates her subjects through fear and threat of execution.

It's a shift in her character that a lot of viewers seemingly overlooked/hand-waved away, but at the end of the day it seems fairly clear that she's just a hypocrite who hates the system when looking at it at a distance from the outside, but has zero problems abusing it to her personal gain when it benefits her.

Basically she claims she's all about free choice, but then burns anyone who doesn't agree with her.","season 7"
"27","I disagree. Pretty much all of Season 7 and 8 were terrible in comparison to the quality demonstrated previously. The story was terrible, the character development was awful, it felt like everyone knew, but they were all powerless to stop this train wreck from happening.","season 7"
"28","Between season 7 and 8: $800+++

Now: 150-300 depends on the fan/collector","season 7"
"29","I've wondered about that myself.  Yeah, the Dothraki are very skilled fighters, and they are extremely vicious, but they are, like you said, strictly light cavalry.  

In Westeros I can see them causing a lot of chaos for a while while they rampage about, but eventually Westeros would unite if only to put them down, and I honestly believe Westeros would have wrecked the Dothraki.

Honestly, if it hadn't been for Drogon breaking the Lanister lines during that battle in season 7, that fight might have gone a lot differently with a lot more dead Dothraki even if they would have still won.","season 7"
"30","Yes they are still worth watching. 

I read all the books before starting to watch them right before season 4 came out and I was a dedicated fan after that. Went to the concert (front row!) and everything. 
I am rewatching the entire series now with my boyfriend and we are currently in season 7. The one thing I didn't pick up on before-- and that had annoyed me when I first watched-- was that the subtle hints of foreshadowing in the dialogue had fallen away. In season 7 it's not so much foreshadowing as it is callbacks to season 1, which is making it more enjoyable this time around.

The boyfriend is loving this btw, and he doesn't understand why he was told to not watch it by people, so you should definitely go for it.","season 7"
"31","I will absolutely agree with this. Binge watchers, and also people who did not read the books. 

Two observations: nothing in the show was predictable. So, I assume that the writers of season 7 and 8 resisted giving viewers a foreseeable happy ending. 

Also, if you truly examine multiple elements, Dani‚Äôs end was foreshadowed multiple times. Actually, everyone‚Äôs end was. I see very little that was completely random or out of character, or even inconsistent with the nature of the show. 

Was there a lot of unresolved conflict and injustice? Absolutely. Back to my point, we‚Äôd been fed this theme all along. 

Not saying I loved it, but I didn‚Äôt have a strong expectation, so I just accepted it. 

This is also the reason I only binge shows üòÇ 

Can‚Äôt spend years attached to people I lose or see mistreated in a way that effs my mind.","season 7"
"32","&gt;She actually only said once there would be no civilian casualties - in 702 - and only because Tyrion argued for it.

That's not what she said and that's not what Tyrion argued for. The writers needed Dany not to use her dragons so that they could justify Cersei staying alive. They accomplished that by having Tyrion suggest that any attack on Kings Landing would end in Dany mistakenly killing tens of thousands of civilians and being the ""queen of the ashes"". Tyrion jumping to that conclusion made no sense.

That's not even getting the fact that Tyrion's blockade idea would have killed more civilians than attacking the city outright.

&gt;Seems weird to fixate on that and just ignore the times she talked about how she would destroy cities or the very clear subtext throughout Season 7 and 8 that she wanted to just smash the city and was being held back by her advisors.

That ""subtext"" was the writers using Tyrion, Varys, and Jon  to gaslight the audience by putting words in Dany's mouth. What they were doing is very obvious if you go back and watch those scenes.

&gt;YARA: If you want the Iron Throne, take it. We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons. We should hit King's Landing now. Hard. With everything we have. The city will fall within a day.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.

No one mentioned turning the dragons loose. What is Tyrion even talking about when he mentions ""fire storms""? That's not a thing. The writers were just desperate to come up with a way to explain Dany not using her best weapons.

The writers have Tyrion and Jon pull the same BS when Dany suggests burning the Red Keep.

&gt;DAENERYS: I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: We've discussed this.

Tyrion was lying here. What they had talked about was Dany attacking Kings Landing. They never talked about her burning the Red Keep. They had Tyrion lie like this so that the audience would connect Dany's new plan with what Tyrion said about her being the queen of ashes in episode 2.

Dany then asks Jon what he thinks of the idea. He responds with:

&gt;JON: ..But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same.

At no point did Dany or anyone else mention burning cities. Dany specifically asked what Jon thought about her burning the Red Keep.

The leaked outline for that scene shows that Tyrion and Jon were supposed to have an issue with Dany using her dragons on anyone. [Including enemy soldiers.](https://imgur.com/2dacXf2)

The gaslighting got painfully obvious in episode 6 of season 7. Tyrion had spent the entire season freaking out whenever Dany or anyone else brought up using the dragons. The writers seemingly forgot that and had him say this nonsense:

&gt;TYRION: Oh first she'd torture you in some horrible way, then she'd murder you. Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me. But if we go to the capital, we'll go with two armies, we'll go with three dragons, and anyone touches you, King's Landing burns down to the foundation stone.

Tyrion flip flopping like this was already bad enough. It's gets worse.

&gt;DAENERYS: And right now she's thinking of how to set a trap.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: Of course she is. And she's wondering what trap you're laying for her.  
&gt;  
&gt;DAENERYS: Are we? Laying any traps?  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: If we want to create a new and better world, I'm not sure deceit and mass murder is the best way to start.

Why is Tyrion talking as if Dany was the one who brought up mass murder? He was the one that had just said that they would burn all of Kings Landing in response to his sister making an attempt on Dany's life.

The writers continued doing this manipulative nonsense in season 8.

&gt;DAENERYS: Cersei will make sure they don't believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem.  
&gt;  
&gt;TYRION: The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King's Landing.

Dany hadn't said anything about destroying Kings Landing.

&gt;GREY WORM: We will storm the city, my queen. We will kill your enemies. All of them.

VARYS: Cersei needs to be destroyed, but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied and the Dothraki, tens of thousands of innocents will die. That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep. These are the people you came here to protect. I beg you, Your Grace. Do not destroy the city you came to save. Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat.

The idea Vary puts forward here is nonsense. The writers didn't even attempt to validate his alarmism. Dany ends up getting the city to surrender without causing any serious collateral damage. The idea that Dany was being stopped from destroy Kings Landing was always nonsense.","season 7"

"34","The show's most honorable charachrer let his sister feed a ""POW"" to dogs at the end of season 7. Killing prisoners you have no use for is standard operating procedure in that world. Book Yara lays that out when she gets captured by northmen.

*The last part was a lie, Asha knew. She might be exchanged, perhaps, shipped back to the Iron Islands to her husband's loving arms.

Season 8 then starts with a Winterfell under siegs by the dead and John wanting to save his sister.

I really don't know why they switched the final boss around. Would it have been anticlimactic with just the white walkers? Maybe, but season 8 always was more of a last hurrah than a deep new conflict/epic emotional culmination. Well, it's too late now... :)","season 7"

"47","Not sure why you‚Äôre including season 7 here. It‚Äôs one of the most consistently highly rated seasons of the whole series.","season 7"
"48","Could read this, https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maesters

Also, maesters are mostly in the show in season 7. If you don't mind spoilers you might watch a few of these clips, https://m.youtube.com/results?sp=mAEA&amp;search_query=Sam+and+maesters","season 7"
"49","I think GOT addresses issues frequently (from religion to slavery to what it means to be honorable or moral to the consequences of needless violence ‚Äî and that‚Äôs ignoring the overarching climate change theme) through the lenses of these characters. The show focuses on the drama of these characters‚Äô lives but like all stories, there are thematic messages. GRRM set the stage for a wealth disparity discussion and D&amp;D kinda just didn‚Äôt follow through and that thread was just kinda forgotten, which weakened the story.

I think a character focused season 7 would have made the season better, given the constraints the writers put on themselves with the shortened season. I think it would have been a way to quickly put key characters in the right parts of their respective arcs without it feeling so empty and rushed. The established pacing was broken in season 7 anyway with characters teleporting across continents in minutes to hours. The character focused stories would have been an extreme choice maybe but it would slow the pace and deepen the intrigue. But with a few more seasons and longer seasons, the show could have just concluded normally.","season 7"

&gt;DAENERYS: Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and **burn cities to the ground.** Turn us away and we will burn you first.


&gt;SPICE KING: Ah. **You are a true Targaryen.**


She actually only said once there would be no civilian casualties - in 702 - and only because Tyrion argued for it. Seems weird to fixate on that and just ignore the times she talked about how she would destroy cities or the very clear subtext throughout Season 7 and 8 that she wanted to just smash the city and was being held back by her advisors.","season 7"
"51","The very premise of season 7 was terrible: Cersei should under no circumstances have been able to claim the throne, never mind keeping it for as long as she did.

The moment she declared herself queen, everyone in King‚Äôs Landing (and the rest of Westeros) should‚Äôve been like ""Wtf!? That makes no sense at all! That woman has lost her mind!"" Cersei could‚Äôve *maybe* declared herself Queen of the Westerlands, since she is Tywin‚Äôs heir and with Tommen dead, there were no legal claimants to the Iron Throne left (Dany hadn‚Äôt arrived in Westeros yet when Cersei became queen), meaning the Seven Kingdoms would‚Äôve been separate once more. 

Instead, she declared herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, and large swathes of the nobility just seemed to accept it for some reason. From that point on, I simply couldn‚Äôt take the show seriously anymore.","season 7"
"52","The last three episodes are a dud. Actually the ending of episode 4 with the Jaime thing was poorly executed. The writing was also bad in order to make Dany lose ground in the first three eps cause she was so OP coming into season 7.","season 7"
"53","Tbh i liked season 7, the story is good only and has good scenes. people hate it because it's too fast paced, has bad writing and isn't too logical which i did agree after watching few yt vids. But still some episodes are good, some bad . But one thing i liked is that a lot of characters get to meet each other. Also i didn't start season 8, will start today and hearing overall it's bad but some people say the first 3 episodes are ok","season 7"
"54","I finished season 7 today and my friends also said the same thing that I should drop got after s6 but i liked season 7 

It depends on you, if you are enjoying it then keep watching","season 7"
"55","Better yet, watch GoT up until season 7-ish. Then head-canon what you would have liked to have happened.","season 7"
"56","It fucking slapped. You should get over the season 7/8 hatred and give it a shot.","season 7"
"57","People keep saying stuff like this because they were hurt after season 7 and 8 came out. I get it. I didn‚Äôt like that they even continued it either. This is based off the books though and they keep it very close to it as a tv show can.","season 7"
